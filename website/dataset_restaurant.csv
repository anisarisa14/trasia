1,Tim's Teapot Terrace,11.00 AM - 7.00 PM,"9128 Jalan Bandar 4 Taman Melawati, Kuala Lumpur 53100 Malaysia",03-4106 2043,https://www.instagram.com/timsteapotterrace/?hl=en,None,"Scones, pots of tea, finger sandwiches. All of these are elements of an English afternoon tea spread, and who doesn't love that? There's something so cosy and comforting about tucking into a warm scone spread with jam and clotted cream. And if you're looking for a spot to have an amazing halal English afternoon tea in KL Tim's Teapot Terrace is here to save the day. Tim's Teapot Terrace is a cafe located in Melawati. Nestled along the quieter Lorong Perak amidst the hustle and bustle of all the shop lots in the area, the unassuming exterior of the cafe will beckon with its cheerful plants and the cakes and teapots being displayed in the window. Once inside you'll find a homey interior filled with couches, draperies, warm lighting, knick-knacks and a mish-mash of furnishings that decorate the whole cafe. While it may look small at first glance, don't worry, there's a further larger seating area through the curtained doorway. The overall ambience of the cafe evokes being in an English grandmother's sitting room for a cup of tea! The cafe has table service, but don't forget to go up to the cake display at the window as well as the chiller counter to see what bakes are in store for the day. It's probably little wonder that a popular menu item at the cafe is the Cream Tea. Comprising two homemade scones that come with jam and homemade clotted cream at the side, it also comes with tea and coffee. By the way, the tea menu is pretty extensive! Serving British Whittard tea, they have everything from the classic English Breakfast Tea to Golden Chamomile, Blueberry Rooibos and Peppermint, to name a few.  But the cafe doesn't just serve tea and desserts, they actually have a full menu of hot food with mains like pasta, burgers and sandwiches plus quintessential British dishes like Shepherd's Pie. They also regularly serve light bites such as soups and croquettes. While the menu is predominantly Western, the cafe has also started introducing specials featuring local dishes on select days (usually Friday), so keep an eye out on their Instagram for further updates. The cafe also has afternoon tea special on alternate Saturdays (twice a month)! Made for two people to share, you'll get an adorable two-tiered serving tray filled with all kinds of goodies including scones, sandwiches and other sweet and savoury treats. As mentioned, it's only served twice a month, so do plan ahead if you'd like to go for it. It's the perfect excuse for a catch up with your BFF!",3.5,28,Cafe,Dessert,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,
2,Nutmeg KL,9.30 AM - 10.00 PM,"Level UG, Bangsar Village 2, Kuala Lumpur 59000 Malaysia",03-2710 4018,http://www.nutmegkl.com/,info@nutmegkl.com,"Cracking open this week, this shining-shimmering cafe's a splendid sight for sore eyes, a dazzling place that Bangsar's brunch-hunters can now come to know. Nutmeg's something of a family enterprise, comprising two brothers-in-law for its shooting stars; Gordon welcomes customers & watches over the service crew, while William minds the menu & mans the kitchen. There's more to the team, but these were the two men we met. The ideal introduction to Nutmeg is its egg-explosive, early-bird selection, offered through the afternoon. Taking us wonder by wonder, we start with this simple but satisfying fried egg, the magic carpet over a mound of sauteed potatoes, salt beef hash & red peppers (RM16+). Don't resist the 'croissant-wich' (RM26+), spilling over with house-cured salmon & the creamiest scrambled eggs. Nutmeg's fare feels touched by homemade, honest virtues, likely since William has spent more time cooking for his family & friends than for restaurants. Hold your breath, it gets better: Spinach frittata (RM18+) stuffed with sun-dried tomatoes, onions & a stinky-special surprise unmentioned on the menu: blue cheese. With time to spare, we at last let our desserts-desirous hearts decide: Warm chocolate pudding (RM13+) with hazelnut praline & vanilla ice cream.  Sufficient coffee to send us soaring, tumbling, freewheeling through an endless caffeinated high.  Not exactly a crystal-clear concept, but it's worth noting that Nutmeg's constructed to evoke spaces in a home, with its own 'front porch,' 'living room' & 'back terrace.'  Let Nutmeg show us a whole new world of local artwork (for sale on the cafe's walls), currently featuring a fantastic feathered point of view. Strictly for the birds, in a sense.",4,134,Cafe,Dessert,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

MAD about Coco makes it more fun with a serving of pure chocolate sauce. Pour the pipping hot sauce over to deconstruct the entire crust, melting everything together to level up the rich, chocolaty goodness.

Begin with brunch: Quartet keeps its eggs running all day long, so customers can have a hearty platter of Eggs Rockafella (RM26.50), featuring lovely poached eggs cushioned with toasted muffins & beef bacon, crowned with capsicum hollandaise, until the kitchen closes at 8:30pm. Swap the bacon for smoked salmon if you prefer fish to meat. Most of Quartet’s ‘Main Table’ repertoire comprises baked produce that’s made fresh in the cafe’s kitchen, so sink your teeth with confidence into a warm, crusty crab toastie (RM33.50), built with rye bread topped with fleshy crab meat, savoury melted mixed cheese & creamy bechamel sauce, served with skillet potatoes for an extra prescription of carbs. Quartet passes the crucial sandwich test too; choose either chicken, with tender pan-seared breast meat & buttermilk sauce (RM30), or steak, with marinated rib-eye & ratatouille (RM29). Each makes a full meal on its own, coupled with side salads. Quartet’s bakers also have some treats up their sleeves for the sweet tooth: Pain blanc, or plain ol’ white bread, becomes a delicious delight with cream cheese, caramel & roselle syrup, sliced for nibbling, with berries & vanilla ice cream. RM13.90. And for the young at heart, try the Baby French Toast (RM13), with tiny twists that tantalise, crusted with cornflakes & flavoured with cream cheese & strawberry jam. There’s still more on the menu, from chai tea-tinged creme brulee (RM6) to affogatos with a peanut butter cookie base & chocolate raspberry sauce (RM10). Quartet proves to be a maestro of milkshakes – no fewer than eight creamy varieties with nicely balanced flavours are currently available, from the top-rated vanilla milkshake with crunchy roasted peanuts & coffee bean bits to a green tea milkshake with almond tuille to a chocolate milkshake with forest berries, each costing RM16-RM17.",4,21,Cafe,Dessert,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Incidentally, the company also roasts their own blends (a selection of beans from Ethiopia, Guatemala, Brazil, Columbia and Costa Rica), with their two signatures being the Maestro and Madonna. The former is punchy and great for a caffeine shoot while the latter is smooth and well-rounded. Coffea Coffee will have to find its footing next to Antipodean and Artisan Roast, but killer blends and an unadulterated passion for good coffee are great yardsticks to measure against the heavyweights.

The open-air setting is something rare in KL, with enough space for kicking a ball around while waiting for the food making it one of the most child-friendly cafés around. Ample parking right next door is another bonus! The café shares the premises with Yayasan Seni Gallery and myBatik workshop which is open for budding artists, and a small batik shop. This would also be a great place to bring visitors to try out batik painting or have some me-time over a cuppa while the kids paint. Coffee is excellent and service is friendly. The food, although not very exciting (think burgers, sandwiches, cooked breakfast and a few pastas), is hearty and home-cooked. The children enjoyed their kids’ set of fish & chips, babyccino and a muffin. We kept quiet about the ice lolly that would have been part of the set seeing that they could barely walk out after polishing their plates. We come here when we are looking for a quick and easy meal for the kids in this area and nice coffee for the adults.

The guy serving us didn’t seem to speak any English or Malay; in fact he only spoke one word to us and the rest of the communication was in grunts, nods and waves! That might be why he missed off part of the order. I went for roti bakar kaya, which is hailam toast with coconut curd and butter, plus some half boiled eggs. Risking salmonella, they come with a runny yolk and a runny white, to which you add pepper and soy sauce. I like to dip the toast in for a sweet/savoury contrast. All fine.We shared some kuih. Getuk-getuk is a cake of pressed grated tapioca topped with sweet and salty coconut. Very dry, but quite good with coffee or the egg. Ang ku is my wife’s favourite, being glutinous rice flour around a sweet bean paste. She also likes the kochi, which is a cone of the same around sweet coconut, coloured with blue pea.Wife summed up Nyonya Colors well – while nothing stands out, most locals would be content to eat there each day.

""We pride ourselves in offering good service and quality food whereby the my son-in-law started the business because he wanted to do something which he knows and sourced for skilled cooks from Pakistan in which the cooking food over charcoal fire is popular back home. It has a lot of similarities with food from the Middle East but the main difference is the generous use of spices, with some providing heat to the dishes such as chilli powder,” he said. As a starter, we had the Mixed Grill (RM65) that arrived with a variety of grilled meats such as mutton, chicken, beef and fish, thoroughly marinated with a special blend of spices. These items are also available as a la carte servings. Among the hefty meat portions are Lamb Seekh Kebab (RM27) which is made with minced mutton wrapped around a squarish long metal skewer and chargrilled, and Chicken Tikka (RM15). Heavily covered with aromatic herbs and a beautiful selection of exotic, freshly ground spices, the chicken and lamb has a hint of bitterness from the charcoal fire, to subtly bring out its flavours. A light, sour yogurt and mint sauce or a homemade tamarind sauce, complements the meat.",4.2,1080,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Naples was known to be the birthplace of the pizza and the gateway to Capri as well as Pompeii, the second most visited tourist site after the Vatican. After visiting Capri and Pompeii over the first two days, and with a free day ahead before traveling back to Rome and onwards to Singapore, Imran decided to rent a car and driver and leave their day in the hands of the local Amalfi Coast expert. Little did Imran know that the next 8 hours would leave an indelible impression on him and Kamilah, a memory that would last a lifetime. o memory could ever supersede the impression that their Hajj had left on their hearts and souls two years earlier, but nevertheless the beauty of Positano that sunny afternoon with the blueness of the Mediterranean Ocean below touched their hearts like no non-place of worship had ever done before. Imran and Kamilah had never seen a town like it, and little did they know that the seeds of a restaurant chain that InsyaAllah could potentially open up a new dining experience for Muslims and non-Muslims alike all over the world, were being sown before their very eyes. As they meandered through the magical alleys down the very steep slope towards the pristine beach, the desire to understand this town's unique history became unbearable. Combined with a burning passion to begin a restaurant that would redefine the experience of casual halal Italian dining, and marry that concept with the gemstone beauty of Positano, Imran could not help but begin a three year process to bring the idea born that very afternoon to reality. Teaming up with his partner and brother-in-law Ishak, a location from which to launch their vision was secured at 66 Bussorah Street.

With around 50 dishes whipped up by nine live stations, this is a safe, comfortable way to savour an all-you-can-eat spread, without the queues of a typical buffet. For guests who remain vigilant about health precautions, Nook's measures are reassuring, with seating that abides by social distancing regulations. Each table has a maximum of 10 persons; larger groups will be split across separate tables. All the friendly staff members ensure the food is professionally prepared and hygienically served; Nook also undergoes frequent sanitisation, so you can sit back, relax and relish a worry-free evening. Ordering is straightforward, using cards and pens provided by Nook - typically, many orders took about five minutes to prepare, so there was minimal waiting. With utensils in clear bags and alcohol wipes provided, we felt completely in secure hands, kicking off our dinner with complimentary canapes that change everyday - tuna with cucumber and potatoes with cucumber offered a refreshing start for our evening. Longtime fans of Aloft KLS know there are two local favourites that have a firm place in the hotel's heart. Both are beautifully represented in the Eat Lah buffet.

Situated in the far end of the revived Bangsar Shopping Centre, the restaurant offers fiery Malay-Indo cuisines in a fine-dining setting, unlike the usual roadside stalls and restaurants that can be found around Kuala Lumpur. Dishes are best eaten with rice and you can choose to have the usual white rice, or slightly fragrant yellow rice that is cooked with spices and turmeric (it’s also good enough to have on its own). Waiters go around with rice buckets; refills are free. We recommend trying the restaurant’s namesake dish, Dancing Fish to start with. This perfectly deep-fried fish dish is served with a choice of five condiments – masam kedondong pedas, tangy acar, mango kerabu, belimbing salad or sambal terasi and kicap, and with the fish in a ‘dancing’ pose on the dish. The bones and the ribs of the fish can be eaten, too, so don’t leave them behind when having this delicious fare. The Bali-famous bebek goreng is also available here, and if you’re wondering whether it retains the same taste as the homeland version, fret not as the Dancing Fish staff were trained in Indonesia to maintain the authenticity of the dishes. The bebek goreng is a proof of this – the marinated duck is so well fried that it is crispy and succulent at the same time and is served with special chilli sauce for added spiciness. Drinks and desserts are commendable items on the menu too, with highlights including refillable barley lime, and the caramelized banana with palm sugar and ice cream. Cendol is also another noteworthy offering; the local favourite is a combination of palm sugar, shaved ice, red beans and coconut milk, and it’s a refreshing treat to have after such fiery meals. Although prices are slightly higher than your usual Malay restaurant, Dancing Fish is a favourite among those who appreciate good Malay-Indo cuisine, and reservations are advised if you’re planning to come during peak hours. The restaurant has another branch in Setia City Mall, so if you’re in the Shah Alam area, consider paying this stellar restaurant a visit.",4.2,387,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

While Nipah’s daily buffet offers a generous variety of Malaysian and Western delights, the chefs focus on the quality of the dishes over the quantity of choices.   And from this writer’s taste-of-view, the quality translates into “super delicious dishes!”. I was impressed with the robust flavours of the local dishes.   On my recent food outings, I have noticed that some buffets seem to ‘water down’ the spice of our local dishes to suit unfamiliar palates. But at Nipah, the curries, satay, curry laksa and roti canai are all bursting with flavours that really excited this experienced Malaysian palate.  For a foreign guest, the taste of the food at Nipah properly represents the magnificent flavours that Malaysian cuisine can offer.  (It should be noted that the Chef de Partie of Nipah recently earned the Gold Medal for his Nasi Lemak at the recent Global Culinary Challenge Malaysia in 2019!). On Sundays, the buffet expands in size and allows guests to enjoy sizzling meats and vegetables fresh off the hot grill.  We went on a Sunday, so we enjoyed the buffet in its full glory.  The meats for the satay and grill section are excellent quality.  The marination is subtle and the grilling professional, so that the full essence of the meat itself is released and you can really enjoy the tenderness and juiciness of the cuts. The grilled vegetables are also very delicious, grilled in buttery marination.  And among the local and western dishes across the buffet, there were enough vegetable options to keep my vegetarian pallet very happy and stimulated. And the desserts are fabulous. Again, I have been let down recently by the lack of flavour of some buffets’ dessert sections.  They look good, but don’t seem to capture the rich taste I expect.  But at Nipah, I was not disappointed with any of the desserts I sampled – and I sampled a lot!  I was particularly impressed with the home-made ice cream. I had the lychee ice cream - it tasted like I just opened a sweet fresh fruit that was made from cream!  It was delicious. Nipah at EQ offers 5 star flavours at pretty reasonable prices, the tastes and quality of the local dishes are quite exceptional. I would definitely recommend Nipah at EQ as a delicious location if you have a penchant for local food and want to enjoy it all in a comfortable and stylish setting.",4.5,201,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Located opposite Bangsar Village 2, along the upmarket Jalan Telawi stretch, it is a halal establishment that also offers thosai, puree, and roti canai. Located amongst some of Bangsar’s higher-end establishments, it is a simple and humble setup with an interior featuring comfortable chairs and tables, hanging artificial flowers and warm, yellow lighting. Though service is not stellar and parking can be difficult (especially on weekends), the reasonably priced and tasty food makes a trip here well worth the effort. A typical banana leaf meal consists of white rice served on a yele sapede (banana leaf) with an assortment of three vegetables, pickles, a selection of curry dishes such as meen kari (fish curry), koli kari (chicken curry), dhal (boiled lentils) and papadum (Indian crackers). Accompanying dishes for the banana leaf rice include lamb, fish, chicken and beef dishes; the chicken masala and deep-fried squid is especially good here.",4,320,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

With a tagline of “best cheese naan”,  we had high expectation before dining in RSMY. Aside from serving cheese naan, RSMY is also known for their nasi beriyani, which they proudly displayed on their signage. Ordering system here is pencil and paper sort of affair, and we jotted down our options without too much trouble. We went with the Extra Cheese Naan (RM8.00) as well as a mandatory tandoori chicken. The Extra Cheese Naan was fluffy and filled with generous amounts of cheese which was thick and ooey.  Sadly, taste wise was a bit of a let down. We felt the cheese slightly lacked flavour, not as savoury as how we thought it should be. The Dhall (RM2) on the side was thick and rick which amp up the flavours. However we felt it’s a little cut throat to charge an extra RM2 for a gravy which usually comes in a standard naan set. Nonetheless it did helped in enhancing the cheese naan. The Tandoori Chicken Breast (RM10) looked slightly different compared to what is usually served in regular mamaks. The colour was lighter and less red, which we assumed was a good thing because lesser MSG and colouring. Even the taste was different to compare to mamak’s tandoori chicken. It was juicier, slightly moist, and had a decent smoky tandoor oven flavour.",4,318,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Later this year they expect to open in Batu Feringghi, Penang, but our meal took place in the slightly more chic surrounds of Starhill Gallery’s Feast Floor. An early weekend evening, the restaurant was quiet enough for us to earn the full attention of the (apart from their insistence that we should require French fries as an appetizer) helpful team. Eschewing the fries in favour of a variety of mezze dishes, we cleaned the plates in no time at all. The judging of any Lebanese or Arabic meal naturally affords much to the appetisers, and they were off to a good start. The hummus I normally prefer smoother and the serve of tahina was not the most generous, but otherwise the offerings were outstanding. The lamb in the kibbeh was joined by tiny chopped onions and crammed with spice. I hadn’t tasted any to this recipe before but it was superb. Worth going back for all on its own. Likewise the sambosa, which were a bit heavy for starters but full of taste. The vine leaves were also excellent and the falafel fresh, crispy and could only have been improved by being presented with more in the way of that tahina. Having crammed so much food in at such an early stage we had to rein things in a bit. That meant sharing a portion of rice for main course and getting just one dish between us. But what a dish it was. The ‘Tarbush Mixed Grill’ included all their main meaty offerings, from Shish Tawook, a variety of kebabs, lamb chops and several of their arayes (spicy minced lamb). I find with most Arabic meals that the meat tends towards the overdone (frustratingly, the Greeks manage to get the balance right consistently in similar dishes) although Tarbush was better than most and the crispy, somewhat tough lamb and chicken was helped enormously by the evidently long period of marination the meat had enjoyed. Given the huge numbers of Arabic tourists that come to KL, it is little surprise that the city has plenty of good Middle Eastern restaurants. Tarbush is, despite some small areas for improvement, clearly among the best.",4,258,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,
65,Contango,8.00 AM - 8.00 PM,"5 Jalan Sultan Hishamuddin The Majestic Hotel, Kuala Lumpur 59200 Malaysia",+60 3-2785 8000,https://www.majestickl.com/contango.html,enquiry@majestickl.com,"Anyone who walked around Malaysian streets noticed many dining options. Nearly at every corner, there is some sort of buffet restaurant. Even though it looks like buffet it is more like a self-service type of Indian diner, Mamak Stalls (Indian Muslim restaurants) or Chinese restaurant. Top that with a food court and you’ll see the Malaysian love of food is serious business. We love that and embrace it with open arms! For this reason, we checked another buffet in Kuala Lumpur (KL), the Majestic buffet KL. The majestic buffet is actually served in a Contango Restaurant, situated in a heritage hotel, Majestic. Contango restaurant is designed in contemporary style, where the range of golden-brown shades holds extravagant impression combined with various sitting options. Just about anything; close to the window wall, lounge chair, classic armless chairs, comfy sofa that you will refuse to leave after the “all you can eat” experience. Next to the Contango buffet, befits some wine from their renowned collection. It is assumed that the Contango wine cellar holds comprehensive wine collection. In case you happen to be more in the spirit’s mood, that is fine as well. If you fancy some beer just talk to the bartender. My favorite part of the buffet lunch is to check all the offers and return to the table with a plate full of food that is the furthest away from our table. Below I’ll mention the dishes I recommend you to try, but keep in mind the offer is much bigger. At Majestic buffet KL, it was the Japanese station, where the majority of dishes lived up to my expectations. Most of all I liked the Soba noodles and Miso soup. I went for hot soba sauce and cooked buckwheat noodles before adding them to the soup. The soba noodles tasted pleasantly silky with tasty clear broth. If you go for the cold dipping sauce, it has all the necessary condiments at hand to season it to your desired taste. Even though the Miso soup tasted great I couldn’t get enough of Wakame seaweed that came in big crunchy chunks. The miso soup tasted mild with deep, earthy notes, which connected well with soft tofu and scallions. Possibly the most diverse array of dishes at Majestic buffet KL belonged to the Mamak, Malaysian – Indian cuisine. Here, one can load the plate with many thick gravies, vegetables, and meat dishes. For the refreshing twist, we swear by some chutney or yogurt addition on a side of a plate. You can combine all the dishes with steamed rice, pilaf rice, roti, potato or bread. Hey, it’s a buffet, no judgment here! Paneer, the unsalted fresh white cheese goes well with this strong tikka masala. Right away it brings the contrast in taste, texture, and colors, which made this dish delightful. The brick pizza oven is an impressive addition of this part. Besides that, I liked the pasta options that are prepared on site. Diners have free hands also when it comes to the finishing touches of mini chicken burgers. That is a special bonus when you know where the cheese selection stands if you know what I mean. Right at the Contango restaurant entrance the dessert display looks inviting, especially petit fours. Sadly they didn’t stand up to my expectations, maybe just the lychee rose and mini fruit tart. Fortunately, cakes per slice were better, especially the fresh Opera cake. Also, brownie delivered strong chocolate with suitable garnish – cream. One more chocolate classic, the chocolate cake felt right, not too sweet and not too dry. It goes without saying that we tried all the flavors at the Majestic buffet KL. Ice-creams that we liked were chocolate and green tea. Right at the side are few toppings to add, and to our disappointment, plastic spoons.",4,357,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Contango.jpg,,

Their food standard is high in terms of taste and variation. Nothing compares to the bread they make here, and I mean it! It really depends on the chef's mood, if not in the mood, the chef makes it still nice, but not as good. There are many times when the bread tastes magical! You may request for the chef to cook the bread a little longer to make it crispier. The dishes to die for here are the chicken and mutton Ogda (served in hot black stone bowl)!! Their taste might be something U've never tried before. The meat was shredded very finely , it almost looks like beaten eggs. I believe the meat in these 2 dishes have been set in oven overnight at a relatively low temperature, allowing the heat to soften the meat. This method might also the reason as to why their mutton doesn't have that 'stinky' mutton smell. This is the first time in my life taking so much mutton, I usually hate the smell of mutton, but this, love it. As for their kebab, I wouldnt say it ranks in the top for their restaurant. Chicken kebab wasn't really cooked thoroughly with some parts in pink, beef kebab proved a little too tough as well, but taste is quite nice. There's not much taste to the fish kebab either except for the salt haha. Love their homemade garlic mayonnaise, great to go with fries! If u're looking at juices, I recommend the grape juice as it's freshly pressed, all natural! All goodness in a cup, mango juice wise, they mix it with puree and mango meat. Not too bad. Service wise, the waiters were really helpful and friendly. Overall, this my if my favourite Arabic restaurant here in Kuala Lumpor, and it's known to serve great food!

Since 1998, Nando's has continued to evolve with Malaysia; when we visited its Bangsar Village branch earlier this month (close to its original roots in Telawi), we were impressed by the recent refurbishments, which bring a brighter, more contemporary look to the restaurant, blazing with vivid colours that match the venue's vibrant Afro-Luso soundtrack (further refurbishments are set to provide many of Nando's 76 outposts in Malaysia with a distinctive appearance at each one of them). There's a carefully curated touch to everything here, from the music playlist to the portraits of Johannesburg life lining the walls (which Nando's exclusively commissioned from South African artists) to every piece of furnishing. Ultimately, the space evokes a warm, relaxed vibe that feels like home, making it an ideal place to reconnect and reminisce with family and friends. That same attention to detail extends to the menu - we were here to check out Nando's new campaign, with the tagline ''Feel The Kick Without The Pinch,"" which spotlights a variety of hearty dishes that demonstrate how a Nando's meal can pleasure your palate without punishing your budget, filling your belly but not emptying your wallet. Quality isn't sidelined either; Nando's chicken goes through a thorough 24-hour marinade, so the flavour flows right into the bone. Only fresh A-grade chicken is used, and it's never deep-fried, rounded out with the unmistakable and uniquely flavoured PERi-PERi sauce. Fun fact: Nando's cultivates its own PERi-PERi chillies in southern Africa in collaboration with small-scale local farmers, to create the special magic of its PERi-PERi sauce, mingling with nuances of onions, herbs, fresh lemons and garlic. The result: Dishes that warm both the heart and the body, such as the Chicken Trinchado, Nando's fowl reinterpretation of a braised beef staple, featuring the honest, home-evoking nuances of chicken in a comfortingly sweetish sauce, coupled with Mediterranean-inspired rice (also RM 11.31). As Nando's loyalists know, most of the chicken here is available in four aromatic flavours: Lemon and Herb, Mild, Hot, and Extra Hot. There's a free flow of PERi-PERi sauce for you to further enhance dishes like the Grilled Chicken Tenders, comprising strips of PERi-PERi-basted chicken tenders, which come with two regular sides of your choice for RM 14.42 (pictured is the Red Skin Mashed Potato and the Chargrilled Veg), representing nutritionally balanced nourishment. We love mixing and matching the various PERi-PERi sauce in the spirit of experimentation; as Nando's describes it, the sauce delivers flavour first, heat second, resulting in a full-bodied sensory experience. If you're in a group and want a starter to share too, we suggest the Garlic Cheesy Pita, blending together the delights of pita bread stuffed inside with a garlic spread and melted cheese for a moreish snack (RM 6.90). Or if you're just stopping by for a refreshing beverage, besides the usual bottomless drinks, Nando's has also introduced a Mango & Lime Cooler, its tropical flavours working well on their own or partnered with the PERi-PERi chicken meals (RM 5.90).",4,248,Restaurant,Fast Food,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

With the motivation of traverse across Middle Eastern sands, we are now able to get a try of the authentic Persian cuisine at the Naab Restaurant. The Naab Restaurant is bringing us not just the authentic healthy delights but it also inspired the beautiful architecture, exotic rugs and more. In Naab Restaurant, we are fascinated with the interior decoration is fashioned after ancient Iranian architecture to make you feel the splendor of ancient Persia. The place is well designed with the Iranian architecture which is capturing my attention on the beautiful interior design. We are also being served with the Persian Delights for the day. The Persian food is very special to me as this is my first time trying the food there. The food which is being served is kinda special to me as the food which is being served. The dishes are mainly more on the healty side of the food where the food is prepared by grilling and it is more to the flavors of the food itself rather than the spices. We had a vast variety of delights from Naab which is well served and the delights is special to me. In Naab, you may find the house special salad where it has a variety of fresh vegetables, beans, eggs, cucumbers as well as the Persian special house dressing. Besides fom the variety of salads, there are also a variety of appetizers which are being served in the Iranian fare. There are Hummos, Taboleh, Olivia Salad, Baba Ghonoosh and many more which is being served in the buffet choices. Hummus, the Levantine Arabian delights is simply a spread which is made from the mashed chickenpeas, blend with tahini, olive oil, lemon juice, salt and garlic. The dish is simply special as well which it is my first time trying them. As for the mains, there are also a variety choices of kebab is being served as well. Besides kebab, there is also Barg Kebab, chicken kebab, lamb kebab and more. The variety are amazingly done and the dish is very flavorful. The flavour are more to the ingridients itself which is more to the healthy option which is less oils and spices. More and more delights to go in Naab for my food review here. There are Okra Stew with Meat as well as brinjals as well. Besides all this delights, there are more lovely dishes like fish fingers,  curry chicken, deep fried fish, Naab Spinach roll Chicken as well as variety of stews as well. The variety is too many too list down but it is very well made and has the fragrance of each ingridients in it. As for the rice, there are also a large selection where there are beriyani rice, dillbbroad bean rice, noodle rice as well as Long Bean rice as well. Each types of rice have a different taste and one of my favorites is the Dill-Broad Bean Rice which is simply unique. Moving to desserts, there are a variety of sweet bites to end your meal. Therehave the Egg Custard, Assorted Deep-fried kuih as well as Colorful Malaysian Traditional Kuih. The sweet delights are as beru sweet delights are very special and the taste is indeed rich and sweet and tasty.

Upon initial appearances, one might feel underwhelmed by the portion of vegetables. For RM7.50 per set, I imagined a more generous serving.

ABC stands for “Always Best Choice” – a big claim! It’s the type of cafe that does a bit of everything. Run by Indians, ABC Bistro Cafe provides everything from tosai to roti, or kaya toast to ‘Western meals’. They’re open nearly around the clock as well – from 7am when we went for breakfast, to 11pm the night before when we walked past on the way back to our hotel. I ordered the Tosai Pisang (banana dosai – or Indian-style banana crepes for those unfamiliar with dosai/tosai!) as I felt like something a little bit sweeter. Given that my experience with tosai pisang has always been as more of a dessert dish, imagine my surprise when it was served up with a range of curries! It actually worked surprisingly well, with the cooked caramelised sugar bananas working well with the spicier and more savoury curries. I also ordered the Roti Boom, another sweet roti served with butter and sugar inside. It was supremely buttery and more-ish, and definitely was more of a dessert than the tosai pisang! Overall though, I feel like the tosai was tastier than the roti. K ordered the Roti Chanai Biasu, a standard roti served with the usual two curries. Again, the roti was nice, but not quite up to scratch. When you can get better roti in Sydney (Mamak!), it’s a pretty good sign that the roti isn’t the house specialty. Feeling the need for a coffee after a long flight the day before, K ordered an Egg Float Toast Set – two poached eggs on buttered toast with a coffee. The yolks on these eggs were super runny, and when drizzled with soy sauce and sprinkled with salt in the Malaysian way, are absolutely delicious when soaked up with thick cut white bread. ABC Bistro Cafe is nothing special, and not something I would specifically seek out the next time I’m in Kuala Lumpur. What it is though, is a great example of simple Malaysian-style food, served up quickly at a cheap price. There are cafes like this all around the country, and they offer small bite-sized snacks of roti and tosai at all hours of the day. The next time I want a roti boom at 7am, 2pm, 9pm, 11pm – no matter where in Malaysia I am, I’ll find a place similar to ABC Bistro Cafe to satisfy my craving.",4,153,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Another signature in Dolly is their Mozza Roll!  We love how the twist the usual prawn roll ( deep fried till perfection) by adding in the melted mozzarella cheese in to it. The taste is perfectly delicious with the crispy bites and the oozy cheese coming out. Egg Custard Bun is a must to order in my list regardless which dim sum shop I go. Their Egg Custard Bun is really good and surprises me! I am loving the ooziness of the creamy salted egg yolk caramel flowing out of it. Asides from dim sum, Dolly Dim Sum do offers stir fried Chinese dishes too. The Royal Golden Fried Rice never disappoint us as the rice comes simply fluffy and filled with the aromatic blend of egg and wok hei in it. It is served together with the pulpy prawns and ebiko which is fresh and good. We ends our meal with their two newly release shake. For those who are looking for some halal dim sum, Dolly Dim Sum is definitely a good choice to go for.",4,147,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Certified halal, this fuss-free restaurant serves chicken rice (both steamed and roasted chicken), along with other local delights such as sambal prawns and kangkung belacan. I’m not a chicken rice fan but the kick ass ginger dip and chilli sauce are what draws me back to eat. And of course, the chicken — steamed or roasted (RM7.50 – chicken leg, RM7 – chicken breast), it’s up to you. If you asked me, I’d say order both to try before deciding on which you like better. Sometimes, you might still be undecided because the roasted chicken skin is tasty, but the steamed chicken has a smoother texture. The sambal prawn is fiery hot and hurts so good. I was sweating buckets (and swearing a little) as I tucked into each spoonful. If you’re a chilli wuss, stay away. No, run away haha! They also serve curry laksa, if you ever have bad cravings the way I do. That said, this curry laksa is more Malay style so it’s a lot spicier. I finished my drink before I hit the half bowl mark. For RM9 per bowl, I found it pretty expensive but they were pretty generous with the ingredients.",4,153,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

It’s an open canteen style place, and it’s one of the biggest in the area. The ceiling fans don’t really keep it cool enough. I’d seen it many times but never made it in. Staff only speak Malay, and they’re a bit rude, though that could be a language thing. They also got both of our meals wrong. Food is so-so – only the price is good, at RM12 for 2 meals and 2 cans. There is a lot better food less than 5 minutes away. I had plain naan, served with a coriander, mint and chilli liquid, a bland dhal, and a terrible star anise chicken curry (according to fiancée) which I had asked be left out. The naan was OK, but I wish they hadn’t run out of cheese. Fiancée’s Maggi goreng (fried instant curry noodles) was very spicy and not too wet, but had nothing interesting about it.

They were one of the first gourmet burger joints that opened in the Klang Valley and one of the few brands that have managed to stay strong and survive. I remember the gourmet burger craze like it was yesterday. To be honest, some were good and some were not. It started around 2012 and by 2016 you could see who stood out and who were too gimmicky to survive. myBurgerLab’s claim to fame is simple. Artisan based meat, buns and original burgers no one else makes. The OUG outlet is actually their second branch. The first was in Seapark, PJ and when they first opened, the lines were phenomenal. I visited them on a Saturday night and they were packed to the brim. There was a line outside but thankfully it moved quickly. The servers were very well trained and they gave everyone in line a menu so that they could decide while standing in line. I made my decision rather quickly. I wanted to try their Nasi Lemak Ayam Rendang burger everyone was going on about. This burger actually started out as a seasonal burger, a humorous answer to Singapore’s McDonald’s Nasi Lemak burger. Diners loved it so much that myBurgerLab decided to make it a staple on the menu. I dragged my vegetarian hubby along and our vegetarian or vegan readers will be glad to know that myBurgerLab has quite a few vegetarian options. The Tofu Burger is interesting because you can pick any meat burger style and replace the meat with a tofu patty. So, hubby picked the Spicy Hawaiian 2.0 Tofu style. You can opt to have your burgers as a set, so I chose the Umami Mashed Potatoes and hubby had the Salsa Nacho. I was curious and wanted a side of mushroom fries so we got that too. They gave us a buzzer that looks like a UFO. Once it rang you could collect your burger at a clearly marked area at the counter. In the meantime, we had fun filling our soft drinks at the bottomless soft drink area. It’s literally a hose that you use to spray the drinks into your cup. Totally groovy! We didn’t wait long, despite the crowd. Our burgers were ready in less than 10 minutes. I did a quick visual sweep around the restaurant and was pleasantly surprised to find that the diners came from a wide spectrum of age groups. One would expect that restaurants like these would only attract millennials and Gen Xs, but there were plenty of young people with their middle-aged parents in tow. Some of them had even brought their grandparents who were in their golden years. I found this thoroughly interesting. So my Nasi Lemak Ayam Rendang burger was really something. It had a very strong layer of rending and sambal sauce. If you like spicy burgers, this is the one to go for. There were so many things going on. The bottom bun had a layer of peanut butter and sliced cucumbers and there was a sunny side up egg on it too. The only thing that didn’t work for me was the crispy batter on the fried chicken patty. I found it a bit too thick for comfort. My favourite part of the meal was the portabello mushroom fries; perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Hubby’s Spicy Hawaiian Tofu was light and sweet, but not overly so. All in all, it was a pleasant evening; except that we had to vacate the seats quickly for the next batch of customers. Things just move really fast here.",4.5,210,Restaurant,Fast Food,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

They had middle eastern music playing on their audio, the waiters here are all of the middle eastern variety, you’d see paintings on the wall with notable quotes from that side of the world and of course, their Menu, most of the things on it – I’ve never heard of, lol, mostly because I rarely indulge in this particular cuisine. Oooo and look at them desserts … yup, the Arabian experience, alright Affordable too, at 5 to 6 ringgit each. I did not give them desserts a try though because lets just say by the time I was done with lunch , I was soooo stuffed that having these small sized desserts would have caused my tummy to burst – if there is such a thing lah but I look forward to giving it a try during my next visit. This was suppose to be an appetizer, the Babaghanoush. Due to my lack of experience with this cuisine, I left the ordering to my friends since they have attempted these dishes many, many times. When they decided to start with this appetizer, I was all in due to my liking for eggplant. The dish basically consisted of ‘ freshly grilled eggplant dip combined with tomato, pepper, onion, parsley ‘ with a good dose of olive oil. It was yummy, had the definite taste of eggplant wit a pleasant mix of flavors provided by the other items. To me, it was a delicious gooey dish of oily, thick puree? gravy? I liked it. While we were placing an order for this dish, the waiter was pretty insistent on us ordering a side of roti/bread with it, and hey, we obliged. He would know best which dishes goes well with what since he comes from the middle east. The roti , Mulawwah only cost us 5 ringgit, so, it isn’t a case of him trying to rip us of by persuading us to order more. If that were the case, a dish worth just 5 ringgit wouldn’t cut it, right? Anyways, he suggested that we order their SMALL option since we were all ” we ate roti canai this morning, we prefer having the smallest possible roti this time since its a starter anyway’ … but when the Mulawwah arrived at our table, our mouths literally dropped open onto the table – look at the size of the roti ??? If this was Small, I wonder what their Medium and Big looked like, lol. It sure was bigger that the usual naans and roti canai we come across often, the texture were pretty similar though. I loved it though, it was thin, soft and moist. It is difficult to explain but the roti was lovely, truly. Whether you have it dipped in some Babaghanoush or simply having it on its own, it still ended up tasting yummy and it cost me 5 ringgit? It sure comes cheap. Our Chicken Mandy was da bomb! It was very good. Oooo man, I got to start with the chicken. The reason I ordered half a chicken rather than the other available option – Quater, was because based on my experience with many other eateries, most of the time, the chicken pieces offered are usually little or smaller in size. So, just to be on the safe side, I opted for half a chicken. When it arrived though, Wowza! when these folks say ‘half a chicken’ then they would deliver exactly that because it literally was a whole piece of half a chicken. Then, when I started cutting into it – the meat was sooooooo tender that it literally fell of the bone. There was no hardship at all, no having to ‘fight’ and ‘wrestle’ with the meat to break it apart. It tasted equally as awesome. There wasn’t as much flavor on the meat as it did on the rice but whatever flavor there was + plus the naturally feel of being baked – simply awesome! Having the chicken with the rice though …. heavenly. That is all there is to say!",4.5,42,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

I say trendy-looking as it has bright colours and the logo is a granny on a motorbike, but it seems a bit too family full to be truly cool. It sells local food in pretty big portions, and I pushed that further by getting a dish which I think on reflection was made for sharing. The vegetable curry is quite rich, but not very interesting overall. However my companions had a wide range of dishes including nasi lemak, Hakka fried rice, and char kuay teow, and they all seemed impressed by the taste and the size. On a different visit I had a dessert of chilled mango pomelo sago, which was like a lassi with tasty chewy bits in, and an umbra (also known as kedondong here, the only English version I have seen is golden apple. It is neither golden nor anything at all like an apple) drink with sour plum. Staff are pretty good, and the restaurant is comfortable enough. In fact the only problem is the price which is really high for Malay/Malaysian food. It does feel a bit too high to justify regular visits, but if you wanted to do a fancy-ish trip with friends it might suit you.",4,371,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

I have been there a couple of times, and but first time at its newest outlet in Level 7 at Pavilion Kuala Lumpur. The interior is, by far, the best at this outlet. I love how the marble top tables add a touch of glamour to the posh, contemporary ambiance. On top of that, the staff is very friendly and responds quickly to our orders. Known for its Malaysian food specialties, we didn't expect that the locally-inspired beverages here are equally good. For instance, the signature iced tea is cooling with a refreshing hint from the mint leaves and lemongrass. Definitely a thirst quencher that pairs well with the meal. We are serious about going local tonight. We order a plate of beef satay despite the fact that Malaysian street food there is albeit pricey. But no worries, quality is assured here. The meat is amazingly moist and the Satay Sauce is packed full of bold nutty flavours with mild spices. Next is the thinly-sliced deep-fried eggplant which can easily get us hooked because of its aroma and crispiness as we happily munch through the snack throughout our conversation. Simple yet addictive! As for the mains, first timers must try the crowd's No. 1 favourite here, the house specialty Nasi Kerabu featuring aromatic blue spiced rice with colorful condiments such as Salted Egg, Ulam, Solok Lada (Stuffed Chilli) and Keropok Ikan. The rice is also served with Ayam Percik. Well-marinated, it is real juicy, but we just can't get enough of the creamy Percik sauce for us because it is so divine and heavily flavoured with spiced coconut milk. Another dish that goes along well with the hot steaming rice is the Beef Rendang. The meaty texture and subtle spiciness are just nice, without overwhelming the senses. Something closer to the Thai's favourite is the beautifully presented steamed fish at its freshest state. A zest of lime juice is great to enliven the dish, packing a punch of tangy appeal that goes well with the oceanic sweetness. A modern interpretation of our local favourite dessert, the crisp battered sweet bananas are paired with vanilla ice cream and palm sugar syrup. Definitely a comforting treat for the sweet tooth. If you are into the sugar-laden combination of crisp meringue, softly whipped cream and berries, then the pavlova here is definitely a must try. Melting perfectly in the mouth, it is so deliciously sinful!",4,121,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Located in The LINC KL, the restaurant features a main dining area, four private rooms and a state-of-the-art event space with projection mapping, spreading over 13,000 sq feet of space in this lifestyle mall. Decked in resplendent colours from a tropical palette, the interior is rich, opulent and vibrant, mirroring Chef Wan's cheery and gregarious personality. The kitchen is led by Chef Wan himself, and features many of his famous recipes from his cookbooks. We were here recently to sample their a la carte menu, which is available daily at lunch and dinner time. Once the Ramadan period is over, there will also be a Tea Time Menu served from 2.30pm to 6pm daily, featuring Chef Wan's famous Nyonya Laksa and Mee Rebus. The portions here are designed for sharing, so it is best to order a variety of appetizers, salads and mains. To start, we highly recommend the Cucur Udang (RM25), prawn fritters deep fried to crispy, golden perfection. Wonderfully crunchy, with large fresh tiger prawns, beansprouts and chives, served with a delicious thick peanut sauce. Without a doubt, the most impressive, best tasting cucur udang we've tried. The kids loved the Chicken Satay (RM30), which featured tender chunks of chicken, well-marinated in local spices, skewered and charcoal grilled for a lovely smoky finish. From the salad selection, we tried the Urap Nangka & Tempe (RM24), made with young jackfruit pieces, tempe, beancurd, long beans and fresh pineapple and tossed in Chef Wan's special ""secret recipe"" sauce. Unfortunately the Kerabu Pucuk Paku with Kerang was not available during our visit, but I would love to try this on my next visit. The Sup Ekor (RM33) is perfect for those who like to start their meal with something warm and comforting. The flavours are robust, with every mouthful tinged with local spices. The Australian oxtail is simmered until tender and falling off the bone. Excellent thirst quenchers - Mint Lychee Soda, Fruity Sangria and Rosey Bandung. For mains, we shared the Ayam Kuah Kacang (RM32), Gulai Lemak Udang Nenas Nyonya Style (RM68) and Sambal Sotong Petai (RM38). To go with your mains, you can enjoy unlimited servings of rice; choose from fluffy white rice, nasi telur Terengganu or nasi kunyit. All the sauces were so good, which made me want to tambah nasi and eat more rice than I should. Gulai Lemak Udang Nenas Nyonya Style - our personal favorite, fresh tiger prawns slow cooked in creamy coconut milk, yellow turmeric and fresh pineapple cubes. The thick, rich sauce was a mix of sweet and savoury flavours, so appetizing! It's not too spicy as well, so the kids enjoyed this thoroughly. For dessert, don't miss the Bubur Som Som (RM16), a soft rice flour pudding topped with creamy coconut milk and cinnamon-infused palm sugar syrup. A beautiful combination of sweet and salty flavours. For durian lovers, try the Bubur Pulut Hitam (RM14), black glutinous rice topped with fresh coconut milk and durian ice cream by Forty Licks.",4.5,44,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

In an alcove looking out onto the narrow back street, the Flutes Living Room @ The Boulevard Hotel looks like a lounge area for hotel guests waiting to be picked up. Indeed, during our entire meal, we were the only ones actually eating here. Everyone else who sat down read papers or chatted with family before heading into a car that pulled up outside. I discovered this place through the Eatigo app during a tiring Christmas shopping day at the Mid Valley Megamall. I am thoroughly sick of all the restaurants within the mall, so I welcomed the chance to try something different. The Boulevard Hotel is directly connected to the mall at the north end, so its easily within walking distance. The main food menu is confusingly branded as “Wild Rice Restaurant” on the front but the concierge confirmed to me that this is the correct menu. There is also a small standing menu that will be on the tables that include some items that are not in the main menu, such as the nachos and the chicken quesadillas. The menu is truly a smorgasbord of different cuisines. There’s a mix of local Malaysian favourites, casual Tex-Mex inspired cuisine, and traditional Italian… sometimes all in the same dish! It’s not listed on either of the menus, but filtered water is free. We ordered their Kampung Pizza (RM28), which was a surprisingly large size for a hotel restaurant. It’s roughly a ten-inch pizza with a thin crust. Mildly spicy rendang sauce is topped with cheese and a mix of white meat chicken pieces and chicken floss. There is a ton of chicken floss compared to actual chicken, and the actual chicken is really dry. The Spicy Cajun Fries (RM16), similarly, was quite larger than what we were expecting. This deep bowl of chips is definitely enough to fill up two people by a good amount. The fries were cooked very well – not too oily and uniformly crispy. On the side was a heaping bowl of spicy queso sauce that was more than enough for all the fries. There was so much sauce that we even dipped our pizza crusts into it, and still had some left by the end of the meal.",4,221,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

It was all started from the founder/owner, Navin who firmly set his path of being a food innovator and restaurateur. Vin’s opened its doors in July of 2009 and from there, the rest is history. One of the guiding principles of the restaurant is the strict adherence to quality. From fresh, organic produce to antibiotic-free, free-range meats and wild-caught seafood, Vin’s kitchen has always made quality a priority. Vin’s make their own sauces, broths and stocks, creating everything from scratch in small batches to ensure the consistency and freshness of the product. It has always been a point of pride that their dishes are all cooked a la minute, arriving at your table cooked specifically for you. What’s best is the fact you get to see the chefs take their pasta making skills to the deck giving guests are chance to see their food being made from scratch right in front of them.  Their cosy interior designed to give the guest a warm welcome feeling and it’s food is drawn inspiration to Navin’s early childhood memories and over the years, they have recreated new menus and mouth-watering beverages combining both excellent flavour and techniques. Vin’s is more than just serving you the best and delicious food, they highly prioritise their service by their staff as well as their handcrafted drinks. Once you enter in Vin’s Restaurant & Bar, you’ll be overwhelmed with a sense of relaxation that you wouldn’t want to leave the restaurant. The current menu now pays homage to Navin’s childhood memories, also draws from his hard-earned maturity as a food innovator. Let’s check it out! This colourful salad really does wonders for your Instagram feed. It comes with crushed almonds, orange, radicchio, celery, baby spinach, avocado, fresh mozzarella, mountain honey and a squeeze of lemon juice. The fact that the acidity of the orange goes pretty well with the rest of the dishes totally blew my mind. The crunchiness of the almonds would be the next best thing as you endeavour this simple yet elegant salad. Overall, the salad has a pretty balanced flavour although you may think the orange may have overwhelmed the taste, I was certainly wrong about that. The tapas in this dish comes with a Hennessey brandy aioli, sea white prawn, basil pesto and a fresh baguette. The juiciness of the prawn is what makes it such a succulent eating experience. If you’re worried the alcohol might overpower the taste, it won’t. The alcohol taste comes as rather of an after taste but blends very well with the pesto itself. Making it an amazing fusion of food. The portion comes with 6 cut down pieces of the crunchy baguette. Hence, a perfect appetiser before moving on towards the main course. Extra info: Also, make sure you try their specials called Funghi Ripieni. It’s a juicy Cajun-spiced button mushroom stuffed with baby spinach & ricotta cheese, baked to perfection and garnished with toasted pine nuts. Served on a bed of honey soy glazed cashew nuts. Looking for an adventure and spicing up your pasta? Prawn Diavollo is here to the rescue. It comes with a hand made linguine noodle, Sabah sea white prawn, garlic oil, chilli oil, cayenne, chilli padi, parsley, shallot, garlic, a Parmigiano Reggiano cheese and to top one last kick to the dish, crushed chilli. There are about four different types of spicy notes in the pasta, so you know they ain’t playing when it comes to how devilishly spicy it can be. Although for those who have good spicy food tolerance, it only comes a shrug off the shoulder, however, you’ll still be panting a little after eating this. When it comes to the flavours, it’s such a simple dish but the flavours just pop in the most right way. A generous portion too so you can share it with your loved ones. Vin’s Restaurant & Bar best seller dish to date. The magnificent presentation of the dish makes it a beauty to behold. The main star of this food is it’s beautifully cooked to perfection Norwegian salmon accompanied by spinach ragout, herb butter, lemon, basil pesto and microgreens. To be honest, the creamed spinach doesn’t leave you feeling satiated but rather the perfect combination with the Norwegian Salmon itself. With the Asian touch of fusion of the honey lemon soy, it gives a slight but great change to the dish in terms of its flavours and the richness of it all. To finish it all off with dessert, Vin’s Restaurant serves also one of their lip-smackingly good sweetness. Treacle Pudding comes with fresh seasonal fruits, cinnamon custard sauce, mint and the steamed treacle sponge cake as the foundation. Creamy and moist pudding made it all worthwhile. Not only does the treacle pudding has a robust flavour but the mint in the pudding makes it a tad crisp and adds an essence of freshness to the whole dessert. Make sure you don’t leave before trying their handcraft alcohol drinks like the Orange Parfait Malbec, Dow’s Fine White Port, and their Vincello.",4.5,503,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,
89,Betel Leaf,11.00 AM - 10.00 PM,"Lebuh Ampang, Kuala Lumpur 50100 Malaysia",+60 3-2032 5932,http://www.betel-leaf.com/,info@betel-leaf.com,"Leboh Ampang is dotted with Indian restaurants with familiar names such as Saravanaa Bhavan and Anjappar. Even with so many restaurants around, almost each of them serve south Indian Chettinad cuisine. If you prefer a non-chain restaurant that’s clean, air conditioned with a slightly upmarket ambience and good food, Betel Leaf fits the bill. Betel Leaf’s menu is seriously extensive and it’d take you at more than a dozen of visits to try everything. Both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes are served here and Tiffin (light meal) is available only after 4pm. We started off with an amazingly delicious Chicken Tikka Masala (boneless) @ RM15. The creamy and rich tasting masala was expertly spiced and went perfectly with the naan. Although chicken breast was used in the dish, it was tender and juicy. The Chettinad Mutton Chukka @ RM18 is a dry mutton curry known for its spiciness. I am not exactly sure how different it is compared to the usual mutton varuval I had at other places, but it does appear less oily with a vibrant color. Taste wise it was flavorful and not as spicy as I expected despite having quite a lot dried chillies in it. The Tandoori Chicken (2pcs) @ RM16 was as good as it could be – nicely marinated, moist with a great smoky tandoor oven flavor. We didn’t really enjoy the Ajwani Fish Tikka (boness less fish marinated with carom seeds and oven baked, RM18) as the fish felt dry and kind of bland. You can’t really taste anything other than the carom seeds’ flavor which I think is quite an acquired taste. Well, maybe that’s just us. Nevertheless, we made it work by having it with onions and mint sauce. Though almost double the price of what other restaurants in the vicinity are serving, I really liked the Madras Filter Coffee @ RM4.50. It was quite strong, aromatic and smooth. As much as I like Indian sweets, the cloying sweetness is just too much for me. I could probably have one piece and that’s all for me. The Kulfi @ RM5 on the other hand, has far more tolerable sweetness. ven though it looks totally different from the menu (where’s all the nuts?) it was still pretty good with a nutty and delicate spicy flavor. And since it doesn’t melt easily due to its density, it can be enjoyed slowly. It is also worth mentioning that Betel Leaf has a farm in Mantin where they rear their own goats, rabbits and grow their own vegetables. So most of the produce used here are sourced from the said farm. That’s why the food tastes so fresh!",4.5,578,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

From now until 30 June 2016, Mandarin Oriental KL's new Executive Pastry Chef Claus Olsen and his team presents Malaysia's first Roger Vivier Afternoon Tea. Inspired by Roger Vivier and his legendary designs, the afternoon tea is priced at RM108 nett per stand and is available daily from 2.30pm until 6.00pm at Lounge on the Park. Roger Vivier is best known for his creation of the first stiletto heel in the 1950s. He designed extravagant richly-decorated shoes that he described as sculptures, and hence was often hailed as the ""Fragonard of the shoe"" and his shoes ""the Faberge of Footwear"". His iconic designs include the Trumpet, Pilgrim pumps with silver buckles as well as his Prismick bag featuring bold, colorful and unique geometric designs. Taking the three iconic designs into account, Chef Claus Olsen has successfully created a stylish yet delicious set showcasing the exquisite details that best represent the brand. The afternoon tea set is served in a three-tier set. Fashionistas will love the Iconic Handbag Butter Cake, Trumpet filled with lemon curd, chiffon and vanilla crumble, and the Buckle frosted Scottish shortbread, all immaculately prepared. Other pastries in the set include the strawberry shortcake with mascarpone cream, roasted pear and caramel milk jelly, pot de creme macaron and green tea milk choux. Scones are served with clotted cream, orange marmalade, and strawberry & rose petal jam. Dainty sandwiches such as Cream cheese sandwich with carrot and cucumber pickles, Beetroot gravlax with sour cream and salmon roe on multi grain bread and Truffle-chicken salad and asparagus in a mini croissant. Guests can choose from a selection of TWG tea to pair with their afternoon tea; I chose the Lemon Bush Tea while Hubby had the Imperial Lapsang Souchong. This is one of Chef Claus Olsen's first projects since joining Mandarin Oriental KL. Definitely an afternoon tea set worth indulging in! Share your 'Afternoon Tea by Roger Vivier' moments on social media with the hashtags #RVXMOTea and #RogerVivierKL and stand a chance to win one of Roger Vivier's coffee table books. Upon learning that I am a big macaron fan, Chef Claus Olsen promptly brought over a selection of his new macaron flavours, which he has recently introduced at the Mandarin Cake Shop. Amongst the flavours which we tried are salted pistachio, blueberry, butter chocolate, hazelnut, lemon, lychee rose, Elvis Presley and salted caramel. They all tasted amazing, especially the latter three flavours :) Impressed I was, and I can't wait to try more of this amazing chef's creations!",4.5,133,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,
91,Samad Al Iraqi Restaurant,11.00 AM - 12.00 AM,"No. 1 Jalan Pinang Unit G-3, G Floor, Menara Prestige, Kuala Lumpur 50450 Malaysia",+60 11-1110 0092,https://www.samadaliraqirestaurant.com.my/,None,"Samad Al Iraqi restaurant sits on the ground level of Menara Prestige, just a stones throw from the Petronas Towers. But it is worlds away from the familiar, and that’s a wonderful thing. Leaping out of an afternoon rainstorm, I shook the rain from my wet umbrella onto the ground outside the front door, and stepped inside.  Immediately, I was transposed to a different land of Arabic and Kurdish architecture, albeit polished and new.  The modest-sized room felt much larger with its high ceilings, low hanging chandeliers, dark wood and arched doorways.  Translucent tiles of cobalt blue and pumpkin orange spotted the walls, and strikingly large and colorful murals depicting civilian Iraqi life danced playfully on the walls.  To round out the pleasant atmosphere, melodic and upbeat music filled the room, loud enough to notice, but quiet enough to remain in the background. Our friendly and eager host invited us to sit and began our evening by placing a steaming hot glass of sweet and dark traditional Iraqi tea before us.  Little is more pleasing than the clink of the spoon against a tea glass as one stirs in sugar, raises it up for a loud sip, and sets it back down on the glass.  This tea was already sweet and intense in flavor, and a perfect antidote to a stormy afternoon. As we sipped the tea, the host brought our attention to an oval fire pit encased in glass, just off the kitchen, and we watched as the chef lit the fire to smoke the traditional Iraqi fish called Masgouf. There is smoked fish, and then there is Masgouf, and when the chef brought out a butterflied filet of Iraqi fresh-water river fish the size of a dinner platter, and spiked it sideways onto the stakes, we knew we were in for a treat. Your meal, as did ours, will begin with a complementary and savory lentil soup with lemon wedges, pickled vegetables that will make your taste buds curl, and a gorgeous fresh basket of plain and sesame pita bread, still steaming upon first tear.  Almost a meal unto themselves, these starters were delightful in color, flavor and freshness. We continued with three lamb dishes cooked in various ways, with a variety of complements.  A very generous portion of grilled lamb thigh served on a bed of rice with currants and vegetable sauce, was succulent and tender (RM 52).  A large plate of grilled lamb ribs served with fresh, stuffed vine leaves, smoky roasted eggplants and potatoes was also delicious, especially with a squirt of fresh lime (RM 52).  Finally, the lamb kabab (minced lamb meat) with marinated and grilled vegetables was a vibrant mix of spices and flavor (RM 49). Three tomato sauce bowls with okra, potatoes, and eggplant were savory additions to complement the lamb, rice, and vegetables.  Reminiscent of tomato vegetable soup, I appreciated these poured over the white rice with the lamb thigh, and preferred the okra (RM 7 each). Although we were nearing satiation, the Masgouf was finished and delivered to our table.  With its intensity of smoked flavor, crispy on the outside and flaky on the inside, this dish could very be the reason you visit Samad Al Iraqi.  At RM 45 per kilo, approximately RM 90-135 could feed a family of four or two couples, with a few delicious complements of vegetables and bread on the side. Rounding out an extravagant dinner of meat and fish, we sampled a delightfully fresh and creamy pomegranate juice with a touch of yogurt (RM 23) and a refreshingly unique dessert of Festekeya with Cream.  Three shaped balls of crushed dates and nuts, rolled in pistachios and topped with a dollop of fresh cream (RM 29), the dessert was very mild, using the natural sugar of dates for sweetness.  Our second glass of sweet Iraqi tea was a great complement to this dessert. Open only three months in this location, Samad Al Iraqi Restaurant has well known establishments in Dubai and Baghdad.  With still some obvious kinks to work out (we were working with a menu from the Dubai restaurant, with many items not available here), the selection, portions, and quality of food and service were still top notch.",4,91,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

94,Passage Thru India,11.30 AM - 3.00 PM & 6.00 PM - 9.45 PM,"No. 4 Jalan Delima Off Jalan Bukit Bintang, Kuala Lumpur 55100 Malaysia",+60 3-2145 0366,http://www.passagethruindia.com/,info@passagethruindia.com,"S P Selva, the 70-year-old owner, has lovingly hand-painted every surface of the restaurant, in some cases, multiple times. S P, an avid traveller (he was in India at the time of our visit), collects curio and decorations as he goes. An intricate and gorgeous wooden front door we’re particularly fond of was initially found on someone’s house! The story goes that he knocked on the door, and made the owner an offer, which apparently, he couldn’t refuse! Gaya, head chef and youngest of the three children, started cooking at a Passage Thru India during her school holidays. While she had planned on a career in IT, the infectious passion she developed for the food put a halt to any ideas outside of the kitchen. Her path was soon refocused, and her drive continues behind the scenes today. With regular travels around India, Gaya and her dad curated a menu of authentic dishes using traditional secrets passed down through generations. Gaya is a firm believer that if you are paying for food, it should be a treat; better than you can make for yourself at home. This was abundantly clear from the dishes to come. Complimentary crunchy pappadams with mint dip and tomato chutney kept the wolf from the door, while we waited for our dishes to be served. The ubiquitous Mango Lassi (RM 7) was slurped down with gusto, with immediate refills requested all round. We started with a Medium Mixed Tandoori Platter (RM 50). The attention to detail to everything on the plate was superb; right down to the delicately carved vegetables. Sea bass was marinated in a yoghurt tandoori dressing (cumin, coriander, lemon juice, turmeric, yoghurt) overnight and cooked to perfection in the tandoor oven. Goat meat, pounded with a mix of spices, created a tender and flavourful sheesh kebab, while prawns were expertly cooked but not overwhelmed by the spice coating. The chicken was presented in two forms. Malai (white) was simply prepared with lemon, coriander, ginger, garlic and yoghurt (no chilli for the spice averse), and the well-loved tikka chicken boasted a slight kick at the end. To mop up the gravies from our mains at Passage Thru India, Mon voted for the Kashmiri Nan (RM 9) with its sweet bursts of dried fruits and nuts. I plumped for the Garlic Nan (RM 6.5), which was as good as any I’ve had before. Chicken Dum Biryani (RM 25) could easily be consumed as a stand-alone dish or shared with an assortment of other mains. It was as visually appealing as it was flavourful. Packed with chicken and spices, it had just a delicate zing to tantalise the taste buds. Lamb Rogan Josh (RM 25), made in the traditional Kashmiri way, with a base of chillies and tomato, really packed a punch. It’s a good partner for the silky Mixed Raita (RM 11), which cools the heat from the tongue. Andhra Fish Curry (RM 23) comes from Andhra in the south-eastern part of India. This region is known for its chillies, which are sun-dried to add a deep smokiness to the flavour. Unlike in Andhra, Gaya adds just a drop of coconut milk to the dish, to make it more appealing to the local palate. As with every recipe, this was made from scratch. Whole coriander and pepper seeds are roasted, pounded and made into a paste, fried in hot oil and stunningly combined with tamarind to add a special touch of sourness. I thought the sauce would work brilliantly with any meat but was reliably informed that it is reserved, specifically, to pair with fish – especially the tender fried seabass that we tried. Lastly, you must consider my favourite North Indian, go-to dish of Bhindi Masala (RM 16) at Passage Thru India. Okra is deep-fried with onion, ginger, garlic, tomato, chilli, coriander and cumin. While on paper this is a simple vegetable dish, the myriad of flavours, however, tingle on the tongue and I declare (Scarlett O’Hara much?) it as one of the best I’ve ever tasted. No Indian meal would be complete without a sweet finale. Gulab Jamun (RM 9,90) is a milk solid based dessert from the Indian subcontinent, famous throughout the region. Milk balls are cooked in clarified butter and then poached in rose and cardamom-infused sugar syrup. They prove a sweet, delicate end to a sumptuous feast. While the food is the heart of Passage Thru India, the venue is the soul. The unique interior design is certainly worth checking out. It makes an excellent location for meals with groups, especially guests visiting from out of town. Service is warm and welcoming, and recipes are highly satisfying.",4,277,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Then, this place is sure to bring out the foodie beast in you. Located in the heart of the city in Avenue K Shopping Centre, Kuala Lumpur, you’re definitely in for a bonus view too. Upon entering, you’ll be welcomed by two Spanish bulls and a Rio Carnival showgirl mannequin with smiling faces from the staff members ready to assist you. You can almost feel the vibe of Brazil as you enter in here from the environment to the settings and the Brazil flag that is hung at the skewer bar area. Before entering into the Skewer Bar, you’ll definitely be wanting to take pictures at the London red telephone box. After you’re done, be ready for more pictures because on the inside is equally as Insta amazing when you first walked in. Each chair showcases famous faces from singers to painters and is adorned by purple hazy lights everywhere to set the mood. Drink by the view overlooking Four Seasons Hotel, Twin Towers and other skyscraper buildings. Eggroni is a type of drink that was created back in the 70’s century when people were having a hard time. In this classic Negroni, the molecular spherical shape like red cherry is to be done in one go. You can feel a rubbery feeling to it as it has a sodium alginate bath and a calcium chloride solution. An experimental drink that you should try! Pordosol is a word derived from Portuguese which means Sunset. From the presentation itself, you have a Campari sugar rim on top for a kick of spiciness for an aftertaste. It has Becker drink mixed with a Czech Republic herbal liquor, orange juice, sweet martini roso reduction with wine, and Moscato. You’ll have a lot of Christmas flavours in there. So far, no one in Malaysia has a unique concept of a steak buffet house but in Samba Brazilian Steakhouse, it fits the description accurately. The buffet here starts at 6 pm onwards and has seafood and much other variety of food to indulge in. All the steak are cooked with a burning charcoal and done in a Brazilian style called Churrascaria. The history behind this style of cooking dates back to early 1800s where European immigrants settled in the Rio Grande do Sul area of Brazil. There were Brazilian settlers that known as Gauchos. The Gauchos cooked large portions of prime meats that were skewed and skillfully roasted to perfection over the pits. This tradition is prepared and served to each table where Samba Brazilian SteakHouse adopted this concept too. Plus, you know you’re in a Brazil mode when the BBQ Section is also a Brazilian that goes by the name Chef Pablo. Oh, the food here is all halal too as the person who takes care and operates the Buffet section is Chef Amir and most of the staff members are Muslim. Rump stick is the best seller and an all-time favourite from the customers in Samba restaurant. A rump steak is a basic equivalent to an American sirloin steak. The ratio of the fat to its meat is about 20:80 and is cooked to a medium rare perfection. You need to eat it to believe the magic of a beautiful steak like this. The lamb steak certainly promises foodgasm in your mouth. Tender, and juicy at first bite. Oh, what a delight it was! If I can recall, the dory fish was one of the buffet options that I kept on eating and eating. Its fish meat is soft and has a beautiful buttery feeling in your mouth that melts to every bit of wonderful.",4,231,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

The staffs are friendly and attentive and will do their best to explain the dishes to you despite the language barrier. The menu is extensive, ranging from traditional middle eastern dishes to seafood and grilled meat. The portions are hearty too, so it is best to come with an empty stomach. It can be daunting as all the names would seem unfamiliar to the typical Malaysian diner. For a safe bet, do sample the Kufta (middle eastern meatballs). Cooked in potatoes, the meatballs are sweet and juicy. They are pretty large too, and the potatoes are soft without falling apart. It is served with either piquant tomato sauce or tahini (ground sesame dip). If you are a fan of chickpeas, do give the Falafel a try. This consists of deep fried balls of ground chickpeas and comes with a salad. The falafel is crispy, soft and crumbly at the same time. There is also a wide choice of Nasi Arab such as the mandy and kabsah rice dishes. The Chicken Mandy is a traditional Handramaut earth-baked rice served with tender chicken and dipping sauce. The rice comes in a huge portion as the long grain basmati rice has a lower sugar content than the regular white rice. Do pair your meal with Arabic desserts like Baklava, or drinks such as Zhorat Tea and Mint Tea. Do note that there is a Surau available for patrons to pray, and that the restaurant is open 24 hours every single day of the week so that you can satisfy your craving for some delicious Arabic food at any time of the day.",4,60,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Al Rawsha Restaurant Kuala Lumpur.jpg,,

Meat Point has been around for over four (4) years, and is known among residents of TTDI and surrounding areas as the go to place to enjoy good steak/ lamb. Owned by a Malay restaurateur, the restaurant is pork-free and alcohol-free and enjoys a good mix of both Malay and non-Malay customers. I’ve been wanting to try it for some time now and finally I had the opportunity to visit one quiet evening. When you wish to order your meat, firstly head over to the meat chiller to select your meat. The meats at Meat Point are chilled and not frozen. Chilled meat is fresh meat produced from freshly slaughtered animals or poultry and stored under refrigeration without being frozen. This results in better flavour and a more even cook. Pass the meat to the staff and tell them your preferred done-ness of your beef/ lamb (please for heaven’s sake DO NOT order anything above “medium” to ensure that you get a juicy and tender steak instead of a piece of rubber). Then head back to your table and order your appetiser. soup, salad or dessert. Scallops in a creamy garlic white sauce with herbs, served with mixed sautéed vegetables. This dish is only available when the scallops are in stock and we were lucky that night that they were! Plump and juicy scallops pan seared and served with some sautéed vegetables! Pretty good value for money I must say. Use the broccoli to soak up the balance of the creamy garlic sauce. Asparagus wrapped in roast beef, topped with melted Cheddar, Mustard, BBQ and Caribbean sauce. These were really gorgeous! Cheesy, meaty and with the flavours and textures of the asparagus, this was a real party on the palate! Don’t share this one among more than two (2) people! Classic mushroom soup cooked with two (2) varieties of mushroom served with two (2) slices of house baguette. I liked the earthy flavours of the mushroom soup which was definitely made from scratch and not the instant/ powdered/ commercial type. It was not too creamy which is good so that you can actually taste the mushrooms and two slices of house baguette was definitely not enough to go with this heartwarming soup! 208 grams of pure bliss! Tender, juicy and oh so flavourful. Each bite was a little taste of heaven! We chose the chimichurri sauce to go along with this however before you slather on the sauce onto your steak, do try it first to appreciate its natural taste. Actually for quality cuts of meats like the one above, I won’t even bother with sauce as all it will do is mask the true goodness of the meat. We ended eating the delicious chimichurri sauce with the potato wedges instead. 180 grams of tender and flavourful lamb cooked medium rare (yes lamb like beef can be cooked medium rare and please don’t waste a gorgeous piece of lamb by overcooking it until it becomes tough and dry like rubber). We chose the mint sauce to go along with it but trust me – the lamb was delicious enough on its own. We ended up wasting most of the sauce. The sides made this main a very hearty dish indeed. I loved the creamy mashed potatoes while the vegetables were decently prepared (I don’t really like eating vege but I try to do so to maintain a balanced diet). A sweet dessert made of smooth, thick custard covered with a hard top of cooked sugar. My partner in crime ended up eating most of this dessert as I’m not much of a dessert person. The creme brulee was a nice sweet end to the meal though and the top was nicely torched ensuring a hard coat of sugar on top of the lovely custard beneath. Meat Point TTDI is an unpretentious neighbourhood steakhouse that really knows how to serve a well-prepared steak! You can opt for a more value for money cut, or splurge on a cut of wagyu for special occasions. The choice is yours! They do have other items on the menu such as pastas and chicken, but their specialty has to be the beef and lamb. The service is pretty good and the staff can assist in explaining the different types and cuts of meats available.",4,53,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

I returned towards the later part of my stay for its delicious dimsums and was offered a seating at the Dim Sum Bar! An honour it see to observe how the dimsum chefs coordinate amongst the steaming of the entire's restaurant order whilst preparing delicate rice rolls at the other side of the bar. As usual, we were served the 8 treasure welcome tea specially brewed and concocted by the restaurant and served by the tea master. I started with an initial order of the 3 special dimsum and my favourite soup dumpling. The first dish was the Lobster Dumpling, shaped with a Shrimp Dumpling served on a bed of lobster bisque. The bisque was rich and full of crustacean goodness, the dumpling skin had a nice chew to it and the lobster fillings was crunchy, sweet and a good thumbs up! The second dish was diced fish meat with Alaskan king crab and broccoli. The king crab meat was over-cooked as it broke away easily after I picked it up. Not exactly what I was looking for, the stock however was very good. I loved the abalone chicken tart, the sauce was flavourful, the abalone was well braised and the tart was crispy and hot. I was however disappointed with the soup dumpling, the filling were decent at best and was not happy to find imitation crab meat within the dumpling too. Next round, we ordered a second and final wave of dimsum. I have no idea where to start. Every dimsum dish is good enough to stand on its own. The mango prawn roll was a sinful joy, fresh ripe mangoes with succulent prawns. The juicy whole scallops ontop the siew mai dumpling, another great dish. The prawn dumpling is to die for, whole chunks of freshwater prawns. With notable mention, my favourite beancurd skin roll in superior sauce is truly amazing. As I was giving praises to these dimsum dishes. My jaw almost dropped when I was informed that Chynna was halal certified, hence there was no alcohol or pork content in any of the dishes I had today and also on my previous post. This has to be the best halal dimsum, maybe even non-halal dimsum that I have eaten so far! If I had to nit pick a flaw, they could do better with the congee presentation. To end off the meal, we ordered a few desserts. Lemongrass Jelly with Coconut Ice Cream, Coconut Jelly, Pan fried pumpkin cake, sea-coconut in longan and pink dragonfruit puree with vanilla ice cream. Maybe the dimsum were just simply outstanding that the desserts failed to blow me away. They were decent, good but could be better. Maybe I would try the mango pudding next time. As I bid farewell to Hilton Kuala Lumpur and my Executive King Room, it is also customary to take a photo with celebrity chef, Chef Lam for memoirs and keepsake.",4.5,705,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,
101,Nadodi KL,6.00 PM - 9.00 PM,"1st Floor, Lot 183 Jalan Yap Kwan Seng, Kuala Lumpur 50450 Malaysia",+60 17-296 9520,https://www.nadodikl.com/,info@nadodikl.com,"We just had an amazing culinary experience through the 11 Mile Journey @ Nadodi KL! Each course was as mind blowing as the next, and the craft cocktails were one of most innovative in KL. Nadodi KL is discreetly located just stones throw away from the Petronas Twin Towers – on the 1st Floor above The Mayang Club at 183 Jalan Mayang. Nadodi means nomad or wanderer in Malayalam. The cuisine is described as engaging and nomadic, as it’s inspired by journeys from Tamil Nadu to Kerala and all the way to Sri Lanka. Patrons can opt for a 7,9 or 11-mile journey menu (vegetarian and non-vegetarian option). I like how the chefs strive to change the menus every 3 months to highlight the best seasonal ingredients. All the dishes on the menus tell a story, whether it is a personal childhood memory, or the background behind the ingredients. We would recommend pairing your food with cocktails here in Nadodi KL. The experience can be a lot of fun because the flavours combination and surprises are endless. We started with two distinctive cocktails recommended by mixologist Akshar Chalwadi. I had a gin based cocktail flavoured with moringa, with rectified vadouvan spices and house made artisanal tonic.  KampungBoy has a concoction made of rotovap burnt dill rum, fermented cucumber syrup and aerated water. Don’t be fooled by the deceptively “clear” appearance of these drinks, both packed a punch with flavour! We started our journey with three bite size courses that  were presented in a beautiful aesthetic way but at its core, the flavours are influenced by by 3 main regions – Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Sri Lanka. We had a semolina crust with coconut filling, water based meringue burger bun with with beetroot patty, and for the white morsels – it resembles a “very Malaysian” dish and they have something similar in Sri Lanka. Make a wild guess! These cute “Takoyaki” balls came to our table next. It is made with fermented batter (reminds us of thosai), filled with chicken kheema paniyaram with melted scarmoza cheese on top. We loved the crunchy “croquettes” filled with tapioca mash spiced with green chillies and onions, just like Kappa Masala – a Keralan style dish. Looking like a frozen lake, this is a refreshing and inventive cocktail concocted with outlandish ingredients such as smoked salmon infused gin, fennel and basil seed infused cordial as well as chilli oil. I’ve tried other fat-washed cocktails but this one is my favourite. The rich, marbled beef is only on the nose. On the palate, the rosemary aroma dominated but overall the flavour combination was well balanced. I love the piping hot and flaky puff pastry filled with flavour-packed egg masala that went really well with some lemon soda and rasam ketchup. Ahh now i feel like having these flaky hot egg puffs from Chennai too! The refreshing scent and delicate, licorice-like flavor of this fennel sorbet makes such a great palate cleanser! So good with cucumber bergamot gel, japanese ichigo and lemon meringue. Big on both flavour and luxury, the lobster “tagliatelle” drizzled with lobster shell oil gave a wonderful burst of lobster flavour on every bite. rapid infused gin with turmeric gin, organic passion fruit, house made spice frosting – refreshing, pretty, and the perfect balance of sweet and tart. Pulliogare, or tamarind rice is a very popular South Indian vegetarian recipe. Instead of rice, the chef uses barley for its chewy texture and nutty flavour, served with charcoal smoked seabass. The rich, creamy almond garlic bisque is made from scratch. The addition of tomatoes, dill and curry leaf oil gave it another dimension of taste. Served with fresh chopped Keerai/amaranth leaves and other fresh herbs, this reminded us of Nasi Kerabu.We were told to mix everything together to experience an explosion of textures and flavours made of crispy sago cracker, fluffly rose-coloured Kerala Matta Rice and Jaffna Crab Curry that is simply a heavenly treat. Bhumi means earth and this beautiful dessert certainly represents the beauty of our earth.  The lavender ice cream was so delicate, so light, so ethereal, so good when eaten together with the crunchy, crumbly soil.  The combination of flavours and textures make this dessert a whimsical delight! The new menu, painstakingly developed by chefs in Nadodi KL, delivers everything you’d expect from a world class restaurant. Each plate is crafted to be the best in its class. Thanks for the great experience, once again.",5,213,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,
102,Serena Brasserie,12.00 PM - 3.00 PM & 6.00 PM - 8.00 PM,"165 Jalan Ampang InterContinental Kuala Lumpur, Kuala Lumpur 50450 Malaysia",+60 3-2782 6228,http://kualalumpurdining.com/restaurant/serena-brasserie,feedback@intercontinental-kl.com.my,"Last week, we were invited to Serena Brasserie at InterContinental KL to check out their new Fresh Market Dining concept. The Fresh Market buffet dinner is available daily from 7.00pm to 10.30pm; from Sundays to Thursdays you can enjoy the international buffet nights at RM138 nett or the 'catch of the day' spread on Friday and Saturday at RM178 nett per adult. So what's NEW about this Fresh Market dining concept at Serena Brasserie? According to Chef de Cuisine Suhalmi Tasir, this Fresh Market dining concept gives guests the opportunity to try fresh, quality produce prepared in their preferred method of cooking. We went around and sampled the fantastic, extensive variety of food on offer, and here are some of the highlights of the new Fresh Market experience: Choose from an array of seafood such as tiger prawn, mussels, sea bass fillet, salmon fillet, squid and more, and then bring it to the live cooking station. Everything is prepared a la minute, so be prepared to wait. However, you will not need to wait in line; simply bring one of the lolly sticks (with your table number imprinted on it) with you to any of the cooking stations, and pass it to one of the chefs with your plate of raw ingredients, while indicating which cooking method you prefer. There are over 10 cooking styles to choose from, such as bouillabaisse broth, Portuguese stew, stone-grilled, Cordon Bleu, deep fried (batter / breaded), teriyaki style and more. You can make your meat and poultry selection from a small chiller - there is striploin, tenderloin, ribs, duck and lamb rack. I would highly recommend the Australian lamb rack - it was beautifully grilled to a medium doneness, so good we had to go back for seconds! There are over 25 selection of vegetables to chose from, simply select and add them to your seafood or meat dishes. Or you can start your meal with a fresh garden salad. Do check out the Noodles counter, and order a plate of sang har mein, aka freshwater prawn noodles. Egg noodles are topped with a smooth egg gravy and halved freshwater prawns. We usually avoid these two items at a buffet spread, however please do not miss out on the risotto ai funghi served here at Serena Brasserie. As I mentioned earlier, the dishes here are cooked a la minute to ensure guests have the freshest, best dining experience. Beautifully prepared, the risotto ai funghi was cooked al dente, and then tossed in the giant Grana Padano wheel and topped with rocket leaves. You can also find Paella Valencia (traditional Spanish rice dish) or Arroz de Marisco (Portuguese seafood rice) here. And of course, not to be missed here is the amazing spread of fresh seafood on ice and sashimi. I love the fatty cut of salmon on offer, as well as the crayfish, slipper lobster and succulent prawns. There are also freshly shucked oysters, crabs, scallops, tuna sashimi and sushi. Pick from one of the freshly squeezed juice bottles on display or select your preferred combination from the display of fruits, and the juice will be delivered to your table. Sinful desserts await you at the Dessert counter, including cakes, pastries, chocolate fountains, local desserts and New Zealand Kapiti ice cream. There is also a nice selection of imported cheese such as Gouda, Cheddar, Brie and Blue Cheese, along with dried fruits and nuts.",4.5,200,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Recently during a visit to Nu Sentral with the kids, we decided to have lunch at Waroeng Penyet, serving Indonesian ""fast food"" such as its famous ayam penyet. Other items here include fried catfish, beef, prawn, soups and grilled items. Place your order at the counter, pay, you will be given a number and the food will be served to your table once ready. We had the Ayam penyet paha (flattened chicken thigh RM10.50) which comes with fried tofu, tempeh and fresh local vegetables (cucumber haha!). The crispy chicken has been marinated in Java spices and then deep fried. It was moist and juicy. You can eat it with one of three types of sambal (self-service) depending on the spiciness level that you like. We also ordered the bawal penyet (flattened fried pomfret (RM14.50)). The pomfret was a good size, so there was plenty of meat for sharing. Similarly it comes with fried tofu, tempeh and cucumber.  Hubby loves the rawon soup (RM10.90), and orders it whenever he comes across it in an Indonesian restaurant. The beef soup gets its colour from the black nut (keluak). Usually the restaurants tend to use lesser quality beef cuts so it can be chewy, but the beef chunks here were pretty tender.",4,39,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,
104,Al Andalus Restaurant,11.00 AM - 12.00 AM,"13 Jalan Delima off Jalan Bukit Bintang, Kuala Lumpur 55100 Malaysia",+60 3-2110 0373,https://www.facebook.com/Al-Andalus-56458743204/,mcsb4422@gmail.com,"The paradox of DC Restaurant and chef-proprietor Darren Chin is that it sets lofty standards and he constantly tries to break them. One cannot separate the emotive chef from the restaurant; his eye for perfection and devotion to world-class standards permeates through the food, the attentive front-of-house, the décor, brand elements and everything that makes fine dining as wonderful an experience as the one in DC Restaurant. Pageantry comes in the form of impeccable execution of classic techniques balanced with innovation, rather than pure reliance on wizardry and trends. That is what establishes DC Restaurant as one of the top fine dining restaurants in Malaysia. Service started the moment we stepped into ‘Le Comptoir’ on the ground floor for pre-dinner drinks. Our editor felt chilly and was quickly met with a guest shawl.  It is such assiduous attention to detail throughout the night that brought the whole dining experience to the level one expects from fine dining restaurants across the world. Ushered to the main dining area on the first floor, the ‘La Salle’, we are greeted by the magnificent ‘Chariot de Fromages’ and a selection of wines for those opting for the wine pairing package (RM350 for 4 glasses). The prix fixe menu options are for 4-Course Light (RM348), 5-Course Taste (RM438) or 7-Course Discovery (RM588). We had the 5-course with wine pairing and their seasonal add-on of the bafun uni from Hokkaido. The strip-jack mackerel provided the right amount of sharpness to open up the palate ahead of the first course, DC’s Spring Seafood Medley. White asparagus from Loire Valley, Hokkaido scallops and Irish bouchot mussels, pearl barley risotto and red mullet pair beautifully with an Alsace, the Albert Mann Auxerrois Vielles Vignes 2016 (RM330), which is light, floral and strong on fruity notes. The white asparagus is spring’s culinary status symbol and DC uses the largest at 22cm. Cooked in a court bouillon, with hollandaise sauce accentuated with mandarin, caviar, Parmesan cheese, balsamic glaze and their in-house green sauce, the medley of melt-in-the-mouth flavours are familiar, yet incomparable. The red mullet with crispy scalloped potatoes and a vin jaune sauce provided the acidity to balance out the creamy and the smokey allusion of the dish. The scallop with a hint of yuzu and avocado sauce showcased DC’s skill with seafood. In between courses, we were fortunate to be served the seasonal Hokkaido Bafun Uni (RM88/piece). We highly recommend this. It’s richer in taste than the Murazaki uni, served with king crab and topped with caviar. It is fresh, creamy and flavourful all at once. The second course was the new signature dish, the Cold Capellini, which replaced the previous somen. The al dente capellini with savoury seafood sabayon and truffled celeriac cream was a homage to fresh produce and a talented chef. The right trace of sourness and the greens to cut the sauce and creaminess of the uni was a beautiful balancing act on a very fine tipping point. The Alaskan King Crab was the third course on the menu and it was truly unique enjoyable. Chunky crab meat, edamame and sushi rice were veiled with a gelee made from tomato water. The salty, textured meat marries beautifully with the beans, the pop of the ikura and the robust tomato flavours. The turbot often appears in fine restaurants, no surprise it is on the menu. The firm texture and mild flavours of the fish, poached in Tuscan olive oil and abalone jus sets itself well against a mild seasoning of fermented beet jus topped with fermented belimbing buluh. A berry granita and mint yoghurt were served between courses – a beautiful break and a signal that every single detail is given thoughtful attention here. At the same time, along came everyone’s favourite Maitre d’, Yann. He noticed that we might be having one too many fish dishes (Chef slipped in the lovely turbot from the 7-course menu prior). He then politely suggested a change from the Market Fresh Fish of The Day for mains to either the beef of lobster, since the lamb was already chosen. Soon after beef was chosen, Agnel seamlessly appeared to provide a different wine pairing for the beef. When that was settled, a beautiful knife box arrived for us to select between a choice of three. Even cutlery was not spared details. The sensitivity and coordination from the front-of-house was pure finesse, never intrusive and with the right amount of lingering, mirroring the fine equilibrium of the kitchen. For the mains, the 14-hour Slow Roasted Rack of Lamb from South Australia comes highly recommended. Non-lamb lovers would be converts, it was that exceptional. Sous vide and grilled to tender perfection, it calls for the third pairing of Domaine Pegau “Selection Laurence Feraud” Gigondas 2011 (RM330) from Southern Rhone, with concentrated dark berries and hints of liquorice and lavender. Medium to full bodied, it provided the right tannins and lingering finish for the lamb. Beef lovers can opt for the Japanese “Hidayu” Full-Blood A5 Wagyu 120 gram (additional RM190) to experience the extraordinary searing of the beef. Really, this was something special. We’ve heard that the chef won’t allow anyone but himself to handle this beautiful cut of meat; he treats that carefully. Savour this one slowly and observe the elegant balance of textures between the charred outer and tender inner. Paired with the Chateau Griviere 2009 (RM300), the tannins were just right to cut through the marbled meat without staying on the palate when dessert arrived. Ending with delightful anticipation was in large attributed to eyeing the arrival of the cheese trolley with the A.O.P cheeses. Diners get to make a selection of three, served with fresh honeycomb wildflower nectar from the hills of Mar-rim Province in Chiang Mai, Thailand. We’d like to revisit again and again just to try them all but do make sure that the Brebis is on your plate. It’s milky and salty and the process of crafting the cheese flowers (with a tool that shaves a thin layer off in a circular motion) is visually entertaining. In the creative line, one of the most difficult executions is to make something complex simple, yet memorable. These are fine lines that Chef Darren Chin and his team have managed to draw with precision and in a continual progression pushing the barriers of the fine dining experience in Malaysia.",4,30,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Al Andalus Restaurant.jpg,,
105,Ahh-Yum by Kampong Kravers,9.00 AM - 10.00 PM,"73, Jalan Setia Bakti Bukit Damansara, Kuala Lumpur 50490 Malaysia",+60 3-2011 2530,https://www.ahhyum.com/,None,"It's past three p.m. on a Wednesday afternoon, but the neighbourhood is still flocking into Ahh-Yum for appetising rice platters, ambrosial noodle bowls and alluring teatime temptations. This cheerful cafe is scarcely a year old, but it already has the makings of a culinary institution in Bukit Damansara, bringing time-honoured Malaysian classics to the table for generations of food enthusiasts to rediscover and fall in love with anew. If you're seeking comfort fare that's bursting with vibrant local flavours, painstakingly prepared in the kitchen without MSG, artificial preservatives or colouring, Ahh-Yum lives up to its lip-smacking moniker, pouring plenty of passion into hearty, soulful nourishment that Mom would spiritedly endorse. So far, customers can find Ahh-Yum in Bukit Damansara, but expect see several more outposts across the Klang Valley in the coming months. The brand, launched in October 2018, is the younger sibling of the Kampong Kravers cafes, known widely for curry puffs and pastries alongside nasi lemak, mihun, chicken chops, toasts, roti canai, cream puffs and cakes. Ahh-Yum expands that selection exponentially, with more than three dozen dishes in its repertoire, freshly cooked and assuredly halal. Ahh-Yum was born out of its founders' love for ayam berempah, the ideal introduction here. The recipe takes no shortcuts, marinated with 18 herbs and spices over at least 48 hours, deep-fried to that distinctively golden crisp, with every ounce of savoury flavour sealed in its moist flesh for pure poultry pleasure. Order the Nasi Basmathi Ahh-wsome! for a sampling of Ahh-Yum's ayam and more, with a hefty portion of leg meat showered with rempah crumbs alongside kambing bakar, sambal sotong, telur masin, acar and sambal merah, all surrounding the rice hued naturally blue with butterfly pea flowers. The platter includes your choice of kuah - asam pedas (spicy tamarind), lemak cili padi (turmeric and cili padi), kari kampong (14-spice curry) or kung pao (sweet soy and sesame). The basmathi rice is worth the carbs, fragrant and fluffy with a relatively lower glycemic index, but if you prefer individual portions of the protein, the chicken, lamb and squid are all also available on their own. And if you crave chicken with fries instead of chicken with rice for a change, check out the Ahh-Yum Chop, originally launched this past Lunar New Year for its vibrantly auspicious colour - it's an indulgent chunk of chicken chop, taking us back nostalgically to the memorable chicken chops we've loved in the past three or four decades, with luscious extra buttermilk sauce on the side. Ahh-Yum's single-bowl rice meals were originally crafted for children, petite enough for lighter appetites but still balanced and sufficient for an adult's workday lunch, especially if you're on a tighter budget. Brighten up your afternoon with the Nasi Ahh-Mah Golden Butter Chicken or the Nasi Ahh-Mah Kung Pao Chicken, with creamy onsen eggs that blend beautifully with the succulent chicken and steamed rice - no chicken-or-egg dilemma here, since you can have both in these fun, fuss-free bowls. For occasions that call for slurp-worthy noodles, Ahh-Yum's variety hits the spot too: Nyonya Laksam surfaces with a choice of mee hoon or laksa noodles, prepared with tuna instead of mackerel for a full-bodied brininess, plus some pineapple for a lively splash of tropical sweetness; the cheekily named Ahh-Yum Hor ""Very Fun"" relies on velvety Ipoh-made kuey teow, served in the naturally sweet chicken-and-prawn soup that has long been the pride of Perak; and the can't-fail Mee Rebus is a familiar staple immersed in a chilli-laced gravy that's thickened with sweet potatoes for a creamier feel, imbued with another Ahh-Yum twist of chicken stock instead of beef (the chicken stock is made from scratch in Ahh-Yum's own kitchen). Kopitiam essentials, reinvigorated for 2019 and beyond. Munching is made merry with Ahh-Yum's arsenal of traditional snacks: Tofu Ahh-Yum is tofu pok that comes stuffed with mashed potatoes for a moreish snack, rounded out with a sambal hitam of deep, dark dimensions, and the Cekodok Pisang blends fresh bananas that are mashed in Ahh-Yum's own kitchen for homemade authenticity. Can't get enough of cekodok? We also relished a preview of Ahh-Yum's unmistakably aromatic Cekodok Cempedak, launching for Ramadan. Ahh-Yum also bakes its own cakes, reflecting a well-honed mastery of desserts, from the delectably decadent Moist Chocolate Cake with Ice Cream to cherished treats like Pineapple Sugee Cake (made with sugee flour from East Malaysia, served with ice cream) and Banana Cake (with ice cream), the kind of cakes you can't - and shouldn't - say no to. Pass us a slice! Even after the food is finished, feel free to linger in this lovely space over conversation and ultra-rejuvenating coolers like the Blue Pea Flower and Lemon Soda, Bunga Roselle Soda, Homemade Lemongrass Pandan Ginger and 4 Sekawan Soda, each shimmering and sparkling with nuanced notes of natural ingredients. It's worth also sipping on some Teh Tarik while taking in the blasts from the pasts that could spark the curiosity of younger customers, like old-school thermos bottles and 555 notebooks.",4.5,20,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

You’re probably well acquainted with the gentle, accommodating side of many Malaysians who are mostly reluctant to confront snide remarks in person. However, when it comes to local food, we rarely let snarky remarks go unreprimanded (think crispy rendang). How did we get this way? The answer can be found in Malaysian comfort food, the very meals we grew up with. After a long day, your typical Malaysian will want a steaming bowl of laksa or the familiar smells of Nasi Goreng Kampung rather than anything fancy. One chain of eateries that has captured this Malaysian spirit perfectly is Ali, Muthu and Ah Hock. We were excited to try out their outlet near Petaling Street, one of the first outlets from this brand to open in KL. This eclectic Malaysian restaurant serves all the signature traditional dishes from all the main ethnic groups in West Malaysia, starting with the nasi lemak. Here, you’ll be able to choose whether you want your nasi lemak with just its accompanying condiments, a.k.a. nasi lemak biasa (RM5) or have it with a piece of fried chicken (RM13.90).  Alternatively, there’s also nasi lemak with squid sambal (RM5.80), rendang chicken or curry chicken ( RM8.70 each). The affordability of the food is also another aspect that makes Ali, Muthu and Ah Hock quintessentially Malaysian. That and the fact that they’ve taken the pains to recreate their outlet to look like an old ‘Kopitiam’, the classic Malaysian coffee shop. Wooden benches are paired with steel topped tables, as well as bare concrete walls that have purposely been left in their rundown state. It really feels like home, especially if you grew up in smaller towns and rural areas around Malaysia. The menu feels all too familiar and growing up in Melaka, I couldn’t ignore the fact that they had Lontong (RM13) on the menu. This dish features blocks of compressed rice in a coconut milk-based vegetable gravy, with glass noodles included too. Back in my hometown, we used to have this almost everywhere, especially for breakfast and lunch. The squid sambal and tempeh on the top was a sure sign that they knew exactly what they were doing. We also sampled the Hainanese Chicken Rice ( RM 12) and I must say that they got the chilli sauce right. You can’t have a good plate of chicken rice if your chilli sauce is off. Finally, we had the butter kaya toast set ( RM6.40) for dessert. The set is only available before 12 pm and after 2.30 pm daily so unfortunately, you won’t be able to order it if you’re here for lunch. Whether you’re a local wanting some good old fashioned comfort food without any fluff, or a visitor wanting to sample authentic Malaysian dishes, Ali, Muthu and Ah Hock is one place that will provide that experience for you in a true and sincere way.",4,68,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Some new items are so intrigued that we ended up going back again during last long weekend. Ordered from appetizer to main course to dessert, because the price is really affordable. Weighing from the nice ambience, use of fresh produce and high quality ingredients plus free parking, you will be surprised at how worthwhile it is to dine in Hilton KL than many other cafes out there. We started with GRAZE homemade pastry. Selections are kept small but not the flavours. Shatter-crisp, flaky outer layer with beautiful honeycomb-like buttery layers within, Summergirl can easily had 3 to 4 all by herself. She highly recommended the Strawberry Danish,  really good. We enjoyed this more than the Swiss Bircher Muesli, which was first launched on GRAZE brunch menu September last year. More nutritious with plenty of fruits in the bowl, more refreshing and easy to be accepted by us who doesn’t really eat muesli. You may not be able to get full by ordering just this, but ideal for sharing. Sliced tomato and mozzarella cheese interlayering each other, lightly flavoured up with aged balsamic dressing. The simple, classic way that can hardly go wrong with. If we were to choose one item from “Fresh Start” list, this will be the first choice, followed by bakery items. We had bad experience with not-so-OK smoked salmon from several cafes last month, so it was really glad to be served with tasty slices of smoked salmon again in GRAZE Hilton KL. Rich smoky flavour without overwhelming saltiness, pairing well with cream cheease, onion rings on try toast. Had all together in one go for best flavours. Coming to “Eggs” choices. There are five to pick from the latest menu but recommendation wise, it is difficult because all are lovely. It depends if you love to have it in poached eggs, scrambled eggs or omelette. We personally enjoyed Single Poached Egg, Ratatouille, Fresh Basil, Parmesan on Sourdough Toast (RM20), as well as Sauteed Tiger Prawns, Two Onsen Style Poached Eggs in Glass with Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Mixed Cress, Multigrain Bread Stick (RM30) – a dish that has got us impressed since our first visit, and still equally delicious till today. Must-try. Done eggs, time for meat, poultry and seafood. Glad to see that our favourite Bavarian Meat Loaf with Lyonnaise Potatoes, Spinach Creamy and Fried Egg (RM48) is still on the list (yay!), together with items such as Grilled Black Angus Gillet Mignon 100g with Sunny Side Up Egg (RM68), Grilled Black Angus Sirloin Steak 120g with Bearnaise Sauce (RM58), Lava Stone Grilled Lamb Cutlets, Herb Crust (RM58), Chicken Schnitzel, Warm Potato Salad, Lemon (RM40), Pan Fried Salmon and Snapper Fish Cake, Tartar Sauce (RM40). For those who enjoy croquettes, Pan Fried Salmon and Snapper Fish Cake, Tartar Sauce (RM40) can probably gain your liking. Fish cake made from salmon and snapper, forming creamy soft filling shielded by thin crispy, golden brown outer layer, further topped with tartar sauce that delivers tangy touch that helps flavour up the entire dish. Finally, Summergirl’s “main course” had arrived. LOL. Dessert girl if you know her well. Decadent Valrhona Chocolate Souffle first try. Perfect “bloom”, pillow soft souffle filled with moist and deep chocolaty. We love this lots! If you like souffle, this is GRAZE Hilton KL is the place you should check out apart from Wild Sheep Chase Cafe. For diners who prefer brunch on a sweet side, Hot Pancakes, Pear and Berry Compote, Ice Cream (RM25) and French Toast, Seasonal Fruits, Maple Strup, Creme Anglaise (RM25) are highly recommended. We enjoy the former the most – fluffy round pancake, dressed with pear and berry compote that carry sweet and sour concoction, crowned over with ice cream. While the berry can be more common, what makes this compote noteworthy is the pear slices, as it adds in refreshing, juicy touch that places a contrary to the berries sauce. For French Toast, the presentation certainly gets all the winning points. Photography worthy, thanks to the laborious effort on topping arrangement, all on top of a thick French Toast brushed with a layer of chocolate sauce. Pour creme Anglaise over and start to indulge in, yummy and no sharing. For beverage, selections cover from coffee like latte, cappuccino, americano to tea including English Breakfast, Earl Grey, chamomile, Fancy Sencha, jasmine gold fruit juice and latest exciting addiction- brunch cocktails and mocktails. Price within RM20 – RM30. If you wondered whether you should dress up for your brunch in this 5-stars hotel, yes you can but since weekend brunch is meant to be “lazy and comfortable”, Hilton KL welcomes you to fit into this without having to worry about your attire. You can even come in with short pants and t-shirt. Just be who you are, the way you like it, walk in and dine like a king with great hospitality from the team.",4.5,341,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Over the years, they have gained popularity around Jalan Bukit Bintang. However, all that glory and fame ended when the quality and consistency of food declined. Despite the drop in standards, restaurant still continue to charge high prices for their food – which is absurd! These cased locals and even foreigners began to distant themselves from most Middle Eastern restaurants forcing the closure of some of them. Fortunately for us, Marhaba Restaurant – Signature Yemeni Cuisine, has much to offer. They are dedicated to offer guests with authentic Middle Eastern experience of fine dining alongside rich tradition of Yemeni food. Beginning with the design of the restaurant, it felt really luxurious and well designed. Consistency of a certain pattern can be seen throughout the restaurant, which includes the glass window, ceiling, walls, partition and so on. Furthermore, various seating options are available as well – indoors, outdoors, on a carpet within a divided section and of course, the private room with a private toilet in it (trust us, that was amazing). Members of Marhaba Restaurant – staffs and waiters were extremely responsive. They also serve with a smile on their face, which help provide a warm and welcoming atmosphere and dining experience. Most importantly, all the food were freshly prepared from scratch with no frozen ingredients – just chilled. Upon ordering, we were given a plate of appetizers, which consisted on several chopped vegies along with a bowl of Lamb Soup and a glass of tea (absolutely free of charge!). The best part about it was the flavor and aroma induced within the soup – absolutely tantalizing. We could literally smell the soup meters away before arrival. It was also rich in the essence of lamb and had a great depth of flavor. With no hesitation, we ordered seconds. We began our feast with a large serving of traditional Yemeni bread that looked like a ridiculously huge ‘Naan bread’ called ‘Mulauwah’. Seriously, it was huge! However, finishing the bread quickly would be the most ideal because it gets cold rather quickly. No worries though, the lamb stew that it came with, ‘Saltah Fahsah’ was rich in flavor and filled with pulled lamb meat that complimented the bread perfectly. Comes in a stone pot, it was savoury, sweet, a tinge of spiciness, hearty and truly worth recommending. Would love that for breakfast! Moving on, Marhaba Restaurant is also famous for its Lamb Hanith, which is selected from baby lamb not more than 6 weeks old. The meat was incredibly tender and the spices and herbs used packed a whole lot of flavor. The meat was so soft that it fell off the bone with ease. The rice that was included was also fragrant, aromatic and flavourful. Last but not least, the portion itself was huge and can possibly be shared among 4-5 people, though we heard stories of an individual finishing it with ease. Loved the flavor, texture and definitely the size of it. Other dishes such as the Grilled Prawns were really good as well. Not only was it fresh, it was seasoned and cooked to perfection! Lovely sweetness of the prawns alongside savory and aromatic ends of the herbs made it truly remarkable and of course, delicious. Hummus, a dish that can be found in every Middle Eastern restaurant, was not left out as well. In fact, it worked pretty well with the ‘Mulauwah’ Yemeni Bread. It had the depth of flavor and was really smooth as well. Light, simple and somewhat addictive. We also had some uniquely-named dishes such as the Chicken Mandi and Lamb Mandi, which literally translate to ‘Chicken Shower’ and ‘Lamb Shower’. Despite the weird name however, it seemed pretty normal. The chicken was red in color and served with rice. It was tender, juicy and had a hint of flavor. The Lamb Mandi on the other hand, was packed with flavor – more compared to the Chicken Mandi. Despite both being prepared with traditional Yemeni spices. Last but not least, we had Honey Dates for dessert. Not those dates that you’ll find in the supermarket but something much more unique. It was basically bread with dates topped with honey – simple but unique. The flavor itself was pretty odd for most of us. Hence we believe that it was an acquired taste. However, loved the fact that it was a nice balance of sweetness between the dates and the honey and really appreciated the idea of it. Marhaba Restaurant also prides itself in its array of mocktails and fresh juices. They have all the basics from Pinacolada to Fruit Punch and even their very own signature Marhaba Fruit Mocktail. Definitely worth the try as their main dishes were all extremely flavorful. So if you’re in the mood for some awesome lamb dishes or even Middle Eastern cuisine in general, do visit Marhaba Restaurant – Signature Yemeni Cuisine for your share of deliciousness today!",4,50,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Marhaba Restaurant - Mandi and Madfoon.jpg,,

110,DIN by Din Tai Fung at Suria KLCC (NO PORK),11.00 AM - 9.00 PM,"Suria KLCC Lot 417, Level 4, Kuala Lumpur 50088 Malaysia",+60 11-6996 3930,https://din-my.com/,info@din-my.com,"Din Tai Fung (DTF) recently launched a Muslim friendly No Pork version of their famous restaurant in Kuala Lumpur (KL) and we drove more than 300km to check them out. Named DIN by Din Tai Fung, the one star Michelin restaurant serves up their iconic 18 folds Xiao Long Bao (Taiwanese Soup Dumplings) with the pork stuffing substituted with minced chicken instead. As soon as we got a seat after a short queue, we were all geared up to stuff our faces. The first item on the menu we ordered was, of course, the Xiao Long Bao. The handcrafted paper-thin Xiao Long Bao with the intricate 18 folds just literally bursts in your mouth with an explosion of flavours. We have tried steamed soup dumplings before but DTF’s Xiao Long Bao is way ahead of their competitors in terms of taste and texture. Definite must try! Ann has a penchant for soups and she proceeded to order the House Steamed Chicken Soup on her next to order list. The clear broth soup was very flavourful and the pieces of chicken in it falls off the bone easily. It is the kind of comfort soup that you will crave for when you are having a cold. The soup truly whets our appetites for more of the food to come. As for me, I ordered the mouthwatering Braised Beef Soup which was truly rich in flavours. The pieces of beef were cooked to tender perfection and every bite of the beef melts in your mouth. However, do note that the soup is very heaty and I was literally fanning myself awhile later to cool down. Next, we ordered a serving of the Crispy Fried Shrimp Wontons. Fresh shrimps in a crispy dumpling wrapper cooked to crunchy goodness served with a dollop of mayonnaise. Ann did not get enough of the Crispy Shrimp Wontons, so we ordered a serving of the Sweet Mayonnaise Prawn. The prawns are battered, deep fried and smothered with sweet mayonnaise. Compared to the Shrimp Wontons, the prawns were huge and pretty filling. We had to take a little breather to finish up the prawns. After trying out the Xiao Long Bao, we decided to give the Shrimp & Chicken Shaomai a try as we questioned ourselves of having shrimp and chicken together in the same wrapper dumpling would give us double the gastronomic pleasures. Sadly it didn’t but still, the Shaomai was great to the last dumpling. Generally, molten salted egg buns we tried are very sweet to our liking but here at DTF, their buns are less sweet and very savoury.  The buns were fluffy too and the creamy flow of salted egg yolk goodness was one of the best custard buns we have tried. To top it all off, Ann ordered the Steamed Thousand Layer cake to take away as we had no more space in our tummies for dessert but Ann die die wanted to try this cake. The soft, spongy steamed cake was a great sweet dessert. It is served with condensed milk and sesame seed paste. A sweet ending to our gluttonous meal. All in all, we spent slightly more than RM200 on our satisfying meal. DIN by Din Tai Fung is definitely a must try restaurant and the road trip we made all 300 km was worth it. We hope that DIN by Din Tai Fung would open one of their Muslim friendly restaurants here in Singapore. Till then, there are always reasons for us to have a short getaway road trip again.",4,120,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,
111,D Empire Pavilion,11.00 AM - 10.00 PM,"168 Jalan Bukit Bintang Lot 6. 33 & 6. 34, Pavilion Kuala Lumpur, Kuala Lumpur 55100 Malaysia",+60 3-2110 6196,https://dempirecuisine.com/,info@dempirecuisine.com,"D Empire Art of Cuisine Pavilion KL – With a catchy all-white front facade near centre area of Pavilion 6th floor (*opposite Tonkatsu)  you can hardly miss out this restaurant when passing by, or perhaps in the next second, already having desire to try it out. For the latter, you should. Specializes in European cuisine, D Empire aims to satisfy diners with delicacies from the continent at affordable price,, in an elegant dining ambience. Food here is prepared by Chef Dallan Tan, an experienced chef who has honed his skills in Europe for many years before returning to homeland. D Empire menu covers a good selections of starters, salads, pizzas, soups, lasagna, pasta, meat, poultry, seafood, risottos and desserts. Among all, Mushroom Risotto, Stuffed Escargots Bourguignon, Australian Braised Lamb Shank, Hazulnut Truffle Brownie and Beef Steak are some of the must-have. For starter, Stuffed Ecargots Bourguignon is our favourite. 6 French snails in one serving, each beautifully spiced up with chopped garlic, English parsley and melted butter that add in mellow sweetness. Caesar salad is kept simple with romaine lettuce as leafy green, tossed with D Empire housemade caesar dressing. Further topped with croutons, parmesan cheese and your choice of beef bacon or smoked chicken ham. Nothing fancy but deserved applause on the effort of making caesar sauce instead of using store bought bottled sauce. Smoked Salmon Pizza in D Empire falls on thin crust version, crispy throughout, not much doughy bites. Spread with tomato sauce and cheese before going for oven bake, then topped with rocket leaves and smoked salmon slices. Summergirl always enjoy the combination of rocket leaves and smoked hence she literally can have the whole pizza to herself. Order if you were same as her. Australian lamb shank arrives in a hearty portion. A little gamey to us but doesn’t matter as the nicely braised meat has taken over the attention – fork tender, dressed in flavoursome reduction of lamb sauce. Complete with a side of mashed potato and  seasonal vegetables. Our favourite in D Empire Restaurant. Risotto is getting more common in Kuala Lumpur but not all done it right, sometimes over rich, sticky and way too difficult to finish. D Empire version is surprisingly delicious! Creamy gravy but not cloying, thickly coated to rice that is still hard at the centre of grain. Tossed with mussels, squid, prawns and clams. Pan-fry seabass with appetizing spicy coulis sauce, a side of vegetables and seasonal superfood salad. Highly recommended if you are planning to have fish dish during your visit to D Empire. Besides, D Empire is prides for their steaks – Australian Ribeye, Australian Black Angu, Wagyu Beef Ribs and Blackmore Wagyu Sirloin. Dessert, the sweetest time for our dinner. Opted for Hazelnut Truffle, a chocolate brownie like sweet treat, strongly infused with taste of truffle. Crowned with your choice of strawberry, vanilla or chocolate ice cream. For beverage, D Empire serves a wide range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, ranging from mocktail, fruit punch, coffee, Gryphon fine tea, soda, ice blended, fruit juices to margarita, long island tea, classic mojito, beer, wine.",4.5,177,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,
112,Mansion Tea Stall,8.00 AM - 12.00 AM,"Jalan Masjid India No 2, Lorong Bunus Satu, Selangor Mansion, Kuala Lumpur 50100 Malaysia",+60 12-331 1456,https://m.facebook.com/profile.php?id=258450821280665&__tn__=C-R,,"Think of the preconceived notions you hold of restaurant ambience, of international cuisine, of legendary flavors and of memorable service. Think of these, then toss them in the bin. Mansion Tea Stall, an open-air hawker nestled within Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, caters to all but your expectations. After an LRT excursion toward Masjid Jamek, a subway station named after a neighboring mosque, seekers of Mansion Tea Stall find themselves surpassing a few noteworthy landmarks. The first of these is a miniature urban courtyard, wrought with commissioned abstract sculpture work and, oftentimes, sleeping locals. Head past and you’ll encounter a bridge that may be eternally under construction (if my three-week stint in the city counts for anything, it’s anecdotal evidence). Whether you find yourself trampling sandbags or hopping over still-wet staircases, you have no choice but to cross this bridge. After all, Mansion Tea Stall lies inconspicuously on the other side, taunting you with aromas of freshly baked vadai and pulled tea spices. As you waltz over the bridge, you’ll find yourself vulnerable to a novel experience. Visit in the heat of the day and you may just stumble upon a monitor lizard crawling along the bank below you. They’re massive, far too closely resembling the related comodo dragon than I’m comfortable with. And if all you’re used to is the rat of NYC, they make for some serious city entertainment. The bridge will end in a snap, and there you’ll find the most unassuming, the tastiest of all hawker stalls in Kuala Lumpur. Mansion Tea Stall appears so abruptly that you may not be sure whether or not the journey to your destination has yet ended. The giveaway is this: long tables and plastic stools blend seamlessly from the dining room into the street, and locals never cease to gather. In Malaysia, a hawker stall houses streetside fare that’s far more affordable than any of its refined counterparts. It’s there you will find the true spirit of the region, the heartbeat of a well-fed nation thriving on bits of Malay culture itself as well as that of China, India and even Portugal. Mansion Tea Stall has got a few dishes down pat, the foremost of which lies in the name. Their teh tarik, or pulled tea, has a strong aura of spices complemented by the fattiness of milk and the sweetness of sugar. Order one and you’ll be treated to a show, as the tea artisan on duty will aerate the beverage by pouring it from one cup in the air to another at counter level. They will repeat this process twice, even thrice, ensuring the warm tea is padded with air bubbles by the time it reaches your palms. This is a drink that Malaysia is known for, and Mansion Tea Stall honors it proudly. A quick roti canai for breakfast or afternoon snack is next on the list. For just over 1 Malay ringgit, you’ll be treated to a pancake, adequately fried in butter, slapped fiercely with bare hands and chopped by a frighteningly large butcher knife (I like to think it gives it character), as well as a bowl of dhal, or lentil curry. Don’t even think of using a fork to dip the roti and carry it to your mouth; this is all a handmade affair. If you’re a bit hungrier, Mansion’s roti special serves roti and curry with a couple of perfectly soft-boiled eggs, making for a meal you actually do require a fork and spoon for. Otherwise, you can opt for the hawker’s very own variant of mee goreng, or Malay fried noodles. At breakfast time, grab a vadai, or lentil-flour donut with savory curry herbs mixed in, to dip in your dhal. As this stall is open 24/7, feel free to make a late-night trip for thosai, a rice-flour crepe served with curry and coconut chutney for dipping. Whatever you choose to gorge in, you’ll be hard-pressed to exceed 2 USD in spending. Oh, and when the bill finally rolls around, it’s often up to you to keep track of what exactly you had. The workers are too busy slapping roti and serving tea to do it for you. Despite its absolutely unassuming nature, Mansion Tea Stall is a place travelers to KL must hit once, twice, maybe five times if you’re anything like me. It’s only two stops on the train from KL Sentral, it’s cheap yet culinarily extravagant, and it’s got some serious local soul. You won’t be able to help from dabbling in conversation with your neighbors (whether they speak your language or not, you’re bound to find some way to communicate, even if it’s just through a few grunts of dining approval). And, if you do it right, you’ll be digging so deep into your food that you’ll have to rinse off at the sink before heading back to the subway.",5,13,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Since 1998, Nando's has continued to evolve with Malaysia; when we visited its Bangsar Village branch earlier this month (close to its original roots in Telawi), we were impressed by the recent refurbishments, which bring a brighter, more contemporary look to the restaurant, blazing with vivid colours that match the venue's vibrant Afro-Luso soundtrack (further refurbishments are set to provide many of Nando's 76 outposts in Malaysia with a distinctive appearance at each one of them). There's a carefully curated touch to everything here, from the music playlist to the portraits of Johannesburg life lining the walls (which Nando's exclusively commissioned from South African artists) to every piece of furnishing. Ultimately, the space evokes a warm, relaxed vibe that feels like home, making it an ideal place to reconnect and reminisce with family and friends. That same attention to detail extends to the menu - we were here to check out Nando's new campaign, with the tagline ''Feel The Kick Without The Pinch,"" which spotlights a variety of hearty dishes that demonstrate how a Nando's meal can pleasure your palate without punishing your budget, filling your belly but not emptying your wallet. Quality isn't sidelined either; Nando's chicken goes through a thorough 24-hour marinade, so the flavour flows right into the bone. Only fresh A-grade chicken is used, and it's never deep-fried, rounded out with the unmistakable and uniquely flavoured PERi-PERi sauce. Fun fact: Nando's cultivates its own PERi-PERi chillies in southern Africa in collaboration with small-scale local farmers, to create the special magic of its PERi-PERi sauce, mingling with nuances of onions, herbs, fresh lemons and garlic. The result: Dishes that warm both the heart and the body, such as the Chicken Trinchado, Nando's fowl reinterpretation of a braised beef staple, featuring the honest, home-evoking nuances of chicken in a comfortingly sweetish sauce, coupled with Mediterranean-inspired rice (also RM 11.31). As Nando's loyalists know, most of the chicken here is available in four aromatic flavours: Lemon and Herb, Mild, Hot, and Extra Hot. There's a free flow of PERi-PERi sauce for you to further enhance dishes like the Grilled Chicken Tenders, comprising strips of PERi-PERi-basted chicken tenders, which come with two regular sides of your choice for RM 14.42 (pictured is the Red Skin Mashed Potato and the Chargrilled Veg), representing nutritionally balanced nourishment. We love mixing and matching the various PERi-PERi sauce in the spirit of experimentation; as Nando's describes it, the sauce delivers flavour first, heat second, resulting in a full-bodied sensory experience. If you're in a group and want a starter to share too, we suggest the Garlic Cheesy Pita, blending together the delights of pita bread stuffed inside with a garlic spread and melted cheese for a moreish snack (RM 6.90). Or if you're just stopping by for a refreshing beverage, besides the usual bottomless drinks, Nando's has also introduced a Mango & Lime Cooler, its tropical flavours working well on their own or partnered with the PERi-PERi chicken meals (RM 5.90).",3.5,493,Restaurant,Fast Food,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

After all, that eating joint is one of the few restaurants that specializes in HALAL Chinese (Szechuan and Cantonese) cuisine and suits us just fine with Muslim members in our family. This restaurant is one of our favourite places to celebrate special occasions. Lovely ambience and wonderful food. We're attracted by its dim sum buffet lunch that offers unlimited dim sum, noodles, porridge, yong tau foo, cakes, fruits and desserts, at a reasonable charge per pax. On the whole, we've always come out happy, fully satisfied and stomach filled to 'overflowing' after a hearty overindulged meal. Haha! However, we have yet to try out its ala carte Chinese dishes, but I'd assume that they could be just as lovely, judging by the tasty, delicious and extensive varieties of dim sum offered during its daily dim sum buffet lunch. Nevertheless, there was a slight setback during our last visit to Meisan to celebrate Yanti's belated birthday on the 3rd Sunday of January! Food was good as usual, but we were a little disappointed with the slow replenishment of food. Probably, the crowd was large that Sunday, thus demand far outweighed supply, though we felt that shouldn't be an excuse! Service was rather slow, appeared short-staffed! Anyway, that was the first time we've experienced the fairly slack service on a Sunday and hope it won't be repeated in future.

Enak in Malay translates to ""tasty"" or ""delicious"", and what a befitting name it is for this well-established restaurant. We recently visited the restaurant for a family meal and the food was absolutely delightful. To start, we had the keropok lekor (RM10), deep fried fish sausage served with a sweet chilli sauce. We're big fans of this traditional snack, so it didn't take long for the lekor to disappear from the basket. For mains, we shared the Ikan Bakar (we selected red snapper) and Grilled King Prawns as well as their signature Daging Rusuk (RM65). All main dishes are served with complimentary rice (either nasi putih, nasi briyani or nasi tomato). First to arrive was the Daging Rusuk, and the staff promptly portioned it out for us and served it on our plates. Great service! The beef ribs has first been braised, then charcoal grilled, imparting a delicious smokiness to the tender meat. The meat was especially good eaten with the air asam jawa as the tangy sauce pairs well with the rich meat. Highly recommended! The fish is seasoned and marinated in their terutup secret glaze, wrapped in banana leaf and grilled. We were pleasantly surprised to find that the whole fish has been skillfully deboned and then put back together to serve as a whole fish, for the diners enjoyment. Moist, juicy and flavorful, this was a big hit at our table (Baby C kept asking for ""more, please!""). The king prawns were also expertly grilled, revealing sweet, juicy and taut flesh. Really good! We also had the Asparagus sambal tumis (RM15) to balance out the meal.

The establishment began in 2006 as a small shop selling food products such as dates and nuts. Now, its a full fledged restaurant owned by Salleh Kym, and restaurant manager, Harris Harvey Siddick. Their ambition with Al Diafah was to serve society with food that touches the souls and brings to life the Middle Eastern culture. It can safely be said that their mission has come to life considering the restaurant is a hit with the Arab community who come from as far as Putrajaya and Bangi for a taste of the Middle East. This level of customer interaction even led them to opening another outlet in Kajang in the beginning of 2014, with two more branches in Shah Alam and Damansara expected to open soon. Where the food is concerned, Al Diafah Express has a wide spectrum of dishes that cover appetisers, pastas, sandwiches, meats, seafood, kebabs, and rice dishes. However, the standout dish has to be the Royal Mixed Grill, which takes approximately 25 minutes to make. The dish has is served with crunchy toasted Arabian bread stuffed with lamb kebab dipped in Tahini Sauce, smokey-flavoured chicken kebab known as Shish Tawouk as well as lamb chops. An interesting thing to note is that Al Diafah Express is that it still sells Arabic and Middle Eastern food products and beverages. Some of these include fruit juices such as mango, pomegranate, lemon, orange, etc. They also sell sweets, dates or date-based sweets, which go well with Arabic white coffee that’s also available here.

Two of the better side dish here are the Sambal Sotong and Fried chicken. The fried chicken had a wonderful smell, moist and tender on the inside. The Sambal Sotong on the other hand is cooked to the right tenderness. The sotong sizes were quite big and the sambal here was quite spicy. Nasi Lemak Wanjo don’t skimp out on the portion of Sotong and the sizes of each sotong was quite big compared to other nasi lemak eateries. The sambal by Nasi Lemak Wanjo is the sweet type but if you are a spicy sambal lover, don’t be put off by that. It tasted absolutely delicious, mildly spicy and paired well with the aromatic santan rice. And if you are yearning for a spicy kick, their sambal sotong is a must to order. The sotong was fresh and tender and we loved how the sotong soaked up the sambal that was cooked in it. Price wise, we wouldn’t call it cheap since it is an authentic Nasi Lemak spot at Kampung Baru. But at least it was reasonable enough as we took 2 side dishes and we feel you get what you paid for. Moreover, it taste absolutely delicious hence we don’t mind the price tag.",4,57,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,Al Rawsha Restaurant Kuala Lumpur,
120,Little Penang Kafe,10.00 AM - 10.00 PM,"1st Floor Mid Valley Megamall, Kuala Lumpur Malaysia",+60 3-7732 9215,https://www.midvalley.com.my/tenant/LittlePenangKafe/14a9d6a2-ca14-4fc3-a4c3-b8ddb7ab2f0c/EAT,None,"An excellent and affordable place to have lunch in Mid Valley Megamall is Little Penang Kafe. As the restaurant name suggests, they serve Penang specialties here such as char koay teow, hokkien prawn mee, assam laksa and curry mee. One of my favorites here is the Char Koay Teow (RM9.80). There is usually a 20 minute wait for this, but it is definitely worth the wait. A hot delicious plate of koay teow with cockles, king prawn (x2), eggs, chives, generous amount of crunchy beansprouts topped with shredded crabmeat. If you like more seafood in your char koay teow, then by all means order the Seafood Special (RM16.00). Personally, I think this is on par with the Lorong Selamat or Sister's version. Definitely not so oily and healthier as no lard is used. Another favorite here is the Penang Hokkien Prawn Mee (RM9.80), a bowl of scrumptious mee and/or beehoon in a spicy prawn and chicken stock, topped with prawns, tender chicken strips, beansprouts, kangkung, half a boiled egg and fried onions. The soup is really flavoursome and thick. I always either have this or the char koay teow. The noodle dishes here at Little Penang are definitely tastier than the ones they do in Madam Kwan. Fuji ordered the Chicken Nasi Lemak (RM9.80); rice cooked in coconut milk accompanied by chicken curry hantu, crunchy anchovies, peanuts, boiled egg, sambal and cucumbers. The chicken curry hantu is not too spicy and has a hint of sourness in the sauce (hot & sour). This dish is nice but the Nasi Bojari at Madam Kwan's is better. So if you fancy noodles, then come to Little Penang Kafe, and if you want a rice dish, then do go to Madam Kwan's for the Nasi Bojari. To finish off our meal, we ordered a Cendol (RM4.50) to share. Ice shavings with a generous topping of cendol, red beans and gula melaka. Definitely one of the best cendols I've had.",4,134,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Alongside an interesting selection of mezze for starters and kebabs for mains, Lana also serve daily changing specials. Monday’s special, steamed rice mixed with pistachios and barberries served with braised chicken, sounded particularly interesting. To start, hummus (£3.50) was rich with tahini yet tempered with a good twist of lemon. Kashke Bademjan (£3.50) was another epic Middle Eastern aubergine dip to add to the collection. Slow cooked aubergines were mixed with yoghurt and crushed walnuts, sautéed chopped mint and Persian whey. A little less oil would have improved the dish but this was seriously good stuff. Bread (£1 each) was up there with the very best – Lilo’s if you’re asking. Cloud light, soft and crisp in places, and baked into a cute heart shape. A jug of mango juice was ridiculously generous for £4 and pretty as a picture with its matching earthenware cups. Salade Fasi (£3.50) was a super fresh combination of lightly-dressed lettuce, cucumber, carrot, tomato, creamy feta and crunchy walnuts. It was missing the advertised olives and  beetroot but I’m not complaining. Onto the mains and it’ll be no surprise to you that I stuck to a familiar favourite – Joojeh aka chicken shish (£7.50). Tender chicken (not quite as juicy as Mowlana’s) was accompanied by a well charred tomato, a mixed salad and a Snowdon-esque mountain of buttery rice. Pots of pokey chilli sauce and a minty yoghurt-mayo completed a very tasty dish. Mrs G ordered Sunday’s daily special - Baqhali polo (£10) – an unfeasibly tender lamb shank accompanied by an Everest-like peak of fragrant rice flecked with dill and soft broad beans.  An accompanying bowl of sauce/soup rich with lamb juices and tomato added an extra dimension to the plate. Lana's food is fresh, good value, hearty and has heaps of flavour. If you’re looking for another Middle Eastern restaurant to try then Lana is well worth a visit.",4,50,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Sukiya has many branches in Malaysia and a few in Singapore. Here’s a short review of this Japanese buffet place. On most days, you’ll have to queue outside before you can even get a seat. Located on Tokyo Street of Pavilion, Suki-Ya is easily the most popular eatery here. It’s cheaper during lunch, i.e. about RM32.80 for adults and half price for children. For dinner, it’s about RM39.80. Children rates are 50% of the price for both lunch and dinner. On weekends and public holidays, it’s RM2 more expensive per person. You can also extend your stay there beyond the 2 hours if you pay RM5 for each additional 15 minutes. Suki-Ya has four soup bases for you to choose from. You can choose 2 out of 4. They have shabu-shabu, miso, sukiyaki and kimuchi. Personally, we ordered the miso and sukiyaki soup bases if I can recall correctly. They also have plenty of sauces for you to choose from. You can get them at the nearby buffet counter. You can order as much chicken, beef or lamb as you want. The raw meat is put into a tray and they are sliced very thinly. They have other food that you can grab at the buffet counter. The sushi here runs out really fast, but they do replenish it quickly. All of the vegetables, mushrooms and other food that you can put into the soup. The other ingredients like mushrooms, corn and vegetables go well with the meat. Eating so much meat alone will make you feel overwhelmed. Suki-Ya also has a dessert section, but it’s just their soft serve ice cream. They have two flavors, matcha and chocolate. You can even choose a mix of both. Just press on the button and it comes out. It’s as simple as that. They have nuts, chocolate rice and other toppings for your ice cream too. Overall, Suki-Ya is a pretty awesome buffet and it’s cheaper than most buffets around Kuala Lumpur. Do be warned however, that eating too much of the meat (like I did) may make you feel nauseous.",4,167,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,
123,Saba Restaurant,10.00 AM - 9.30 PM,"Off jalan Setiawangsa Jalan Jelatek, Setiawangsa, Kuala Lumpur 54200 Malaysia",+60 3-8320 2544,http://www.sabaholdings.com.my/,None,"It’s a shame that I have been working in Cyberjaya for over a year and I have yet to post any food in this area. Well, to be honest there are not many great restaurants nearby. The good ones would be expensive or too far for a typical working day’s lunch or dinner. I only allocate RM5 to RM7 for a meal you know? It seems a lot but actually it’s just enough to buy yourself a decent, edible meal in Cyberjaya. Then I found Saba, a restaurant serving Middle Eastern food. Starting with the nicest of all the food I have had before at Saba – Lamb Tikka Rice @ RM15. A plate of rice cooked using spices served with flavorful cuts of lamb which were first marinated with yogurt and spices. I don’t know what were those placed on top of the rice but I didn’t like it because they tasted sourish. If you look carefully at the next dishes, the rice used in Middle Eastern cuisine has a slimmer and longer shape. The rice was so skillfully cooked that each grain was separated from each other completely! Followed by Lamb Kebab Rice @ RM12. The difference between this and Lamb Tikka is obviously the lamb – which was grilled on a skewer instead. The only reason this dish lost out to Lamb Tikka was because the meat was too dry and lacked flavor if compared to Lamb Tikka. Don’t misunderstand though, I am not saying Saba’s Lamb Kebab is bad, just that their Lamb Tikka is too good hence making the rest seem so so. Another lamb dish I tried was Lamb Kabsah @ RM15 which was lamb wrapped in aluminum foil and pressure cooked with herbs. If you don’t like lamb, you could opt for Chicken Kebab instead @ RM9/10.. can’t really remember. Oh you can choose between rice and pita bread for any kebab set too. Like for this one, the Chicken Kebab was served with pita bread so it came with some extra fries and sauce. I feel pita bread is more suitable for girls because the portion of rice served is very big. Yeah I know the food I have mentioned cost more than what I have allocated for my daily meals. This is where the Quarter Roast Chicken Rice @ RM8 comes into picture. Eight bucks for a quarter chicken meal with plenty of flavorful rice is a steal in Cyberjaya, and you are guaranteed to be full after finishing it lol. Remember to request for the imported chili sauce to spice things up, it tastes different from the local ones. Besides, the chili sauce adds the much needed moisture too. Another thing you should try here is the Barbican drink – an imported non-alcoholic malt beverage @ RM3 each. It comes in different flavors too like Regular, Lemon (best), Rasberry and Peach. If you are wondering, Barbican tastes like sparkling juice minus the over-sweetness. There are actually many other Middle East Restaurants nearby. You can even find one in MMU itself but I have surveyed the prices there. It’s far more expensive than Saba, which is why I recommend this restaurant instead. The food here is no doubt rated above average to good for me, but I really dislike the bad service. That ‘don’t care’ or ‘tak kisah’ attitude displayed by the staff especially the cashier is quite annoying sometimes. Other than that, it’s quite OK and the food is definitely halal. Saba Restaurant is located opposite Cyberjaya’s bus terminal at the newly opened shoplots, only a few shops away from Secret Recipe. Portions prove princely - even a single serving could satisfy two light eaters. The Yemen-style lamb mandi is packed so tight, its contents nearly spill out when you open the container. The meat is smoky and fall-off-the-bone tender, well-balanced with a spicy-sour sauce (RM28.78). The Mixed BBQ is more a feast than a mere sampler (RM45.58) - chicken kebab, lamb kebab, chicken shish taouk and beef tikka, all conveying a distinctive Mideast spice mix seeped into the marinade. The chicken is our favourite for its easy-eating virtues, while the beef is on the chewy side and the lamb has a slight sourish yogurt aftertaste. Sides include a salad, fries and flatbread that can be heated up for ideal enjoyment. Saba delivers out of Persiaran Multimedia in Cyberjaya.",4,52,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

This restaurant is situated near to the offices thus it has a good flow of traffic from the white collars during lunch hours and dinner hours. Located on the first floor of Nexus Bangsar South, you can find the Muslin Chinese restaurant where Islamic food is legal. There are many office buildings near this restaurant, so many white-collar workers visit here during lunch and dinner. Personally, I have visited this restaurant a couple of times just for its tomato noodle. Yup, probably this is the first time you heard of it, its ramen served together with thick tomato broth. For me, I have visited this restaurant several times for its tomato noodles. Yes, this may be the first time you have heard of this food. It is ramen noodles with thick tomato meat sauce. The springy ramen is served in a hot thick tomato broth comes with either chicken cutlets or beef cube depending on your preference and a tiny broccoli. The meat in this dish is really'stingy' as the proportion of noodle to meat is 90: 10 or probably 95:5 only. However, the noodle mixed well with the broth and can be further improved if the broth has more tomatoes infused. The springy ramen and the hot, rich tomato meat sauce, you can also choose your favorite meat between the chicken slices and beef cubes, and it has a little broccoli. The meat of this dish is really stingy, because the ratio of noodles to meat is 90:10 or 95:5. However, the noodles and meat sauce match perfectly, and I personally think that this dish could be better if the meat sauce can be added with more tomatoes. The noodle comes in ala-carte and set. In a set, it contains 2 skewers of chicken, and 3 side dishes; 1 braised egg, 1 vegetable and 3 little dumplings. Set is quite filling so its advisable to share if you are having a small appetite or alternatively you could go for ala-carte. There are a la carte or set menus here. The set meal includes 2 chicken skewers, 3 side dishes, 1 braised egg, 1 dish and 3 dumplings. The set menu is quite generous, so we suggest you share it with others if you are a bird appetite, or you can order this dish. The fruit tea that they serve here is just nice, not too sweet and not too plain. It contains of variables fruits in the drink; pineapple, red dates, apple and nata de coco/jelly. Do go for'Jug' selection if you are visiting with a group of friends because its cost effective and you can request for refill with hot water but bear in mind that it will gradually dilute the taste of your drink. The fruit tea here is just right, not too sweet or tasteless. This drink contains several kinds of fruits, including pineapple, red dates, apples and jelly. If you are going to this restaurant with a group of friends, it is recommended to choose a large pot, because it is more worthwhile and you can ask for heated water, but please remember that after heating the water, the taste of the drink will be diluted.",4,57,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Let's start with PULP, the one that has opened with the biggest buzz. PULP rests in the shadow of Riong's Balai Berita building, the head office of the New Straits Times Press. It occupies a site that was previously the paper-cutting space for the nearly 50-year-old Art Printing Works factory & storehouse. PULP is run by respected Singaporean coffee boutique Papa Palheta, the people behind the city-state's Chye Seng Huat Hardware & Loysel's Toy cafes; it might be the patriotic responsibility of every Singaporean expat in KL to support this place. PULP's opening afternoon proved the most well-received of any KL cafe's in recent memory; the owners of numerous other establishments _ from Brewmen to Wondermama, Thirdwave to VCR _ could be spotted here, mingling with curious cats & eager beavers, ahead of an official launch in the evening by Singapore's high commissioner to Malaysia. The pedigree, experience & expertise of the people behind PULP ensure that it's well worth visiting. This is a welcoming cafe with a friendly team, easygoing vibe, singular look & clean layout; even with the legion of coffee bars stirring in the Klang Valley every week, PULP looks poised to be one of 2014's best bets. PULP _ a name with links to both paper & coffee _ will mean different things to different people: For most, it'll be a hangout where we can nibble on light bites & sip top-flight coffee or buy freshly roasted espresso blends & single-origin beans. But PULP also aims to be a sales & service centre for coffee gadgets & a space for professional training, cupping sessions & workshops. It was a fortunate coincidence that we shared a table with Art Printing Works' Ee Chong Kok, one of the three brothers who've spearheaded the company since the 1960s. He explained that PULP is part of a vision _ led by younger members of his family _ to create a place that pays homage to the time-honoured traditions of printing while keeping the business relevant at this turning point of history when nearly everyone relies more on smartphones than paper. This was the only cafe that had a press release prepared for its launch. Its current menu is kept simple & elegant _ accessible & not intimidating at all for casual coffee drinkers, but fascinating enough for people who might instantly associate phrases like ""Brazil Cerrado"" & ""Indonesia Ratawali Valley"" with coffee.  It's a beautiful balance _ the same description that's applicable to our coffee. You'll currently find La Cupula & La Flor Del Cafe (both Antigua Guatemala) & Blue Batak (Lake Toba) here.  ... plus medium-bodied cold-brew (Suke Quto, Ethiopia Sidamo) of _ according to the official description _ a candied sweetness & citrus acidity. No lack of food, thankfully: Familiar, well-executed fare that ranges from chicken pies to mushroom quiches, carrot cakes to raisin scones & fruit tarts. The Yin & Yang of PULP's desserts, one Eastern, the other from far West. We liked the lovely, fresh-tasting steamed pumpkin rice cake & the creamy-rich chocolate tart. Come right in, the food's fine.",4,93,Cafe,Coffee N Tea,static/restaurant_pics/Pulp.jpg,,
126,Eight Ounce Coffee Co,7.30 AM - 8.00 PM,"Unit 115 Level 1 Suria KLCC, Kuala Lumpur 50088 Malaysia",+60 3-7622 8780,http://www.eightouncecoffee.co/,letschat@eightouncecoffee.co,"Shoppers running perilously low on caffeine can recharge at two mall-based coffee bars that began brewing this past month: L'esprezzo at The Curve & Eight Ounce Coffee at The Gardens. First up, L'esprezzo, operated by The Loaf bakery-cafe chain as part of its bid to capitalize on the Klang Valley's spiraling demand for better-tasting coffee. L'esprezzo taps the services of Barista Guild Asia industry trainers & relies on single-origin beans, combined for a signature blend of Brazilian & Colombian that was available for this visit, to keep standards relatively high. Try the tasty 'Cube60c' (RM12), featuring frozen espresso cubes poured over with hot milk in perfect proportions, for satisfying caffeine-dairy synergy. 'Artisan sandwiches' are listed on the menu, apparently exclusive to L'esprezzo to keep the brand distinct from branches of The Loaf. Choices include chicken wraps with feta cheese, red onions, lettuce & tzatziki sauce (RM22). Regular pastries are offered too. L'esprezzo is likely to open its next branch at a Cheras mall. Complimentary coffee alert: Eight Ounce will officially celebrate its opening by giving away 188 free takeaway cups of hot lattes at both its outposts, on a first-come, first-served basis of course, on Jan. 8. Other customers will be entitled to a 50 percent discount off all coffee on that day. Coffee is advertised as the number one reason to visit, but we soon find there are a number of other delights to entice a return too. A mix of Arabica beans from Brazil, Colombia, Guatemala and Indonesia make up the house blend, which proves a well-balanced medium roast. Double shot ristretto is the standard base for milk coffees and, most will find the outcome to be smooth and chocolaty with a touch of citrus in the finish. My Flat White (RM12) is done just the way I like it with a double ristretto and thick velvety milk. In general, I find the beverage even and well-rounded in the mouth right until the very end when it exits on a mildly sour note. Hubby enjoys an Earl Grey tea (RM9) served in a pot and allowed to seep to his preferred strength as an alternative to coffee. Besides coffee, sweets are a definite highlight at Eight Ounce Coffee Co. Sourced locally from home-bakers, the offerings are original and a welcome variation from the standard red velvet and carrot cake options. Original Crepe Cake Crepe cakes, or millefeuille, at Eight Ounce Coffee come in a variety of flavours and we try both the Double Chocolate Crepe Cake (RM11.90) brandishing a mild chocolate flavour with a heavy cream dominance and, the Hazelnut Crepe Cake (RM11.90), sporting a hardened hazelnut cream topping. Both are good and we guess personal taste preferences will decide your final favourite as the texture is uniformly delicate in all three. Besides crepe cakes, Eight Ounce Coffee Co. serves up some decadent, calorie-laden, mouth-watering desserts. The humble name Choco Bar (RM15) gives no indication as to the outrageousness of this sweet. “Wow!” is my ruling thought from start to finish.  A flaky crunch in the base supports a dense rich orgasmic-ly thick wedge of silky dark chocolate. It’s topped with powdered cocoa and spiked with broken slivers of chocolate. Save me!

Afternoon tea at St. Regis Kuala Lumpur features a selection of cakes and entremets, served on a three-tiered platter in pretty pastel colours. Even the teapots and cups are in pastel hues, and you get a tea sommelier to take you through their series of tea – light, fruity or bold. For RM140nett, the afternoon tea comes with a choice of tea, sandwich canapes, scones, pastries and sandwiches. The bite-sized sandwiches are passed around throughout the session and you get to pick from a selection of four – king crab and avocado, smoked salmon with crème fraiche, foie gras on toasted brioche and egg mayo with black truffle. All were good in their own right, but I particularly enjoyed the foie gras on toasted brioche and king crab and avocado. Couldn’t resist a second and third! You’re served two types of scones with your afternoon tea set; plain and cranberry, and they come with homemade strawberry jam and clotted cream. I thought they were pretty good – buttery yet light, and delicious with lashings of cream and jam. While afternoon tea is usually a proper affair, St. Regis Kuala Lumpur makes it interesting by adding fun treats like chocolate shooter and cake pop into the mix. I feel that loosens up the vibe a little as it gives you more things to ’oooh’ and ‘aaah’ about.

Despite having coffee as the centre stage, Ra-Ft KL is worth visiting for more than just caffeine-fix. Food here, especially brunch options, are real good stuff. From laborious home-made breads and home-cured salmon to things as basic as poached eggs, you can get them right and tasty here. Easily our top recommendations when comes to breakfast/brunch places in KL. Ra-Ft KL first opened in Binjai 8 Premium Soho Ampang, a quiet oasis away from the hustle and bustle of the city, yet centrally located as it is only about 20 minutes walk from the iconic KLCC Twin Towers, at the same time easily accessed from LRT Ampang station – like just 5 minutes away. Another branch is in Arcoris Mont Kiara, opposite to Hyatt House Mont Kiara, also the building next to the new 163 retail park. Not sure when it was opened, maybe last year, as we saw it when going for dinner at Majapahit Arcoris.

French Toast, Egg Benedicts, Bagels, bircher Muesli, fish, poultry, pho, salad, pasta, pad thai, burgers, pancakes, French croissant, big breakfast – have your choice. Two types of big breakfast are offered here – Ra-Ft Breakfast with fixed combination of home made bread, butter mushrooms, baked beans, roasted tomatoes, streaky bacon, chicken/pork sausage, scrambled egg/sunny side up, Ra-Ft smashed potatoes; and Create Your Own Breakfast RM28.50 where you can choose your bread (multigrain/gluten free/ croissant/ english muffin), the way you like your eggs (scrambled/sunny side up/fried both side/ poached), your proteins (chicken sausage/pork sausage/bacon/home cured salmon), and two sides to go with (mushrooms/baked beans/roasted tomatoes/smashed potatoes). The Botanist RM25 – a vegetarian dish that caught Summergirl’s attention the most, as not many cafes have vegetable-loaded brunch dish like this other than salad. Gluten free bread with mashed peas spread, further layered up with broccoli, zucchini, kale and pea sprouts! Not to forget, a poached egg hidden within. Besides all-day-breakfast, Italian-style Carbonara pasta,  Lemon Cicken Scaloppine, Fish & Chips, Ra-Ft  Signature Burger are worthwhile too. Coffee is rather price friendly. Below RM10 for our latte and cappuccino. Plunger, Vietnamese style and cold brew Speciality coffees are available too. Or you can go for Chai Latte, Matcha Latte, Beetroot Latte, Golden Milk Latte, Hot Chocolate and healthier beverage  like fresh juices. Order a dessert if you still have rooms after the meal. Ra-ft House Made desserts received plenty of positive reviews too. Ra-ft Tiramisu, Bread & Butter Pudding, Pavlova with Fresh Fruits, Gluten Free Chocolate Brownies, Ra-Ft Bird Nest with Vanilla Ice Cream – give them a try! Overall, we enjoyed our brunch here. Nice coffee, delicious food. Loud applause to their friendly and helpful staffs even though being busy. It was a full house when we reached that day, but the staff tried their best to get us a table outdoor. We said we didn’t mind waiting but the staffs still politely ask few diners if they could separate the extra tables for us, instead of leaving us to queue and wait.

Breakfast is served: Lucy is the latest place where people can customize their brunch platters, choosing three items for RM12.90 & adding RM3 for every extra selection. Lucy In The Sky promises relatively healthy cooking, relying on organic ingredients whenever possible. But that's not necessarily meant to provide customers with carte blanche to overdose on four preparations of eggs in one sitting: poached, scrambled, sunny-side-up & over-easy even if the eggs are partnered with deliciously nutritious lentils & buttered corn.

Feeka Coffee Roasters KL located at Jalan Mesui turned to be our last week choice, seeing that it is one of the most  raved about coffee place recently, near to our staying place and quality assured with the enthusiastic team from Butter+Beans at Seventeen, Happy Mansion, PJ. Located in between Palate Palette and No Black Tie along Jalan Mesui, Feeka Coffee Roasters shares a different concept compared to the two restaurants, roaring the morning of the quiet street with visits from coffee lovers, busy churning out one after another cup of good coffee and hearty breakfast. Ample of seats for both indoor and outdoor, but mostly small tables to cater for two persons. But no worries as you can always join them together in case you came in larger group. The whole cafe unwinds a relax, no frills environment, with a touch of unique style that combines nature and modernity. Cable spool table with yellow colour lazy chairs; white chairs with black table and wooden bench;  exaggerate cushioned chairs in leaves’ pattern with dark oak, oval shape colour coffee table; fresh plants in bottle; a stretch of wall painted to have brittle finishes, etc… …bits and everything here strives to be bold, putting unmatched combinations into  incredible matching when seen in the whole. A little different from many other coffee places which highlights on wooden elements, even though the you-have-seen-many-times-before pendant light bulbs still appear.  But Feeka Coffee Roasters have gone a step further in creating their own personality. The operation counter in Feeka Coffee Roasters places a contrast to the indoor dining area which light up in hue yellowish. The section draws ample of natural lights during daytime, with white colour walls, white square tiles to promote a clean, simple touch. Barista is seen pouring one after another cup of coffee with beautiful latte art, in full attention with impeccable skills. We hope for a buttery croissant, but too bad it wasn’t in sight during our visits. But trays of cakes in playful and basic flavours such as Olive Oil Carrot Cake, Chooclate Coffee Tart, Lavender Cherry Pound Cake, Coconut Cheese Cake make a good choice with coffee. Business at Feeka Coffee Roasters was at brisk during our visit, but there were still few vacant tables. So we suggested to arrive before noon, as the place started to get full house by the time we left. Order is on self-service base, so just grab a menu from the counter and choose your favourite. A number written on wooden block will be given to you after paying. Orders arrived in a jiffy- our cuppa of hot cuppuccino (RM10.00) and hot chocolate (RM10.00). Coffee is good, but Summergirl loves the hot chocolate more. We experienced quite a few over-sweetened hot chocolate, but this one is just nice, richly laid with chocolaty, milky yet not too sweet. Speciality brew is available too, so do ask for your aeropress, cold brew, and more. Food choices for breakfast here doesn’t go far from the footmarks of big breakfast, putting together sunny side up or scrambled egg together with toasted bread, sausages, saute mushrooms and more. However, creation such as Brioche French Toast with Spiced Pineapple and Orange Sauce brings interesting option to the menu. Our Scramble Platter(RM16.00) appears to be normal, having crispy toast sided with creamy scrambled egg. But replacing usual chicken sausage with lamb sausage makes the platter turns worthwhile. Summerkid enjoyed the meaty, juicy munch of sausage that carries a hint of gaminess. After 11:30AM, more extensive choices such as Beetroot Salad, Duck Sandwich, Feeka Beef Burger, Meatball Pasta, Steak & Fries, and Salsa Seabass are ready to be ordered at reasonable price; while all-day-breakfast continues. In short, Feeka Coffee Roasters KL proves to be another cafe in town that is doing good. Not too bad overall, and ambience is great.",4.5,344,Cafe,Coffee N Tea,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,
131,VCR,8.30 AM - 5.00 PM,"2 Jalan Galloway, Kuala Lumpur 50150 Malaysia",+60 3-2110 2330,https://vcr.my/,hello@vcr.my,"As the blog turns 7 in a few months, I recall the wonderful times I’ve had, life experiences I’ve gained along the way, friends I’ve made and wonderful opportunities I’ve been presented with. Alas, it hasn’t been smooth sailing throughout. With success comes great responsibility, and not to mention haters. I’ve learnt that there is no point trying to explain myself (or my blog principles) to such people, as they seem committed to misunderstanding me. It’s a shame when some fail to understand why rif and I run the blog the way we do, and despite telling many we both have a full time job, they don’t get why I can’t just drop everything I do at the office just so I can attend events or reviews. While I am grateful to be considered, I don’t rely on the blog for income unlike some bloggers. And rif and I manage the blog and brand it the way we deem fit. Besides, who’s to say we’re doing it wrong? I brand people and businesses for a living and am good at it. I’ve stuck to my principals and the reason (and foundation) for starting the blog. Like Ee Han of VCR Coffee in Kuala Lumpur. It took me a while to make my way down there despite working nearby and the coffee is good. VCR occupies a house at the corner of the street and the ambiance is one of my favourite thus far; wood and brick elements, high ceiling and warm lighting. The baristas know what they are doing – they are skilled and articulate, and the coffee machines are serviced and properly tended. VCR’s atmosphere made me forget I was in Malaysia, for a while at least. My flat white (RM10) was just what I needed to perk up my day. It was well made, at about 65-70 degrees Celsius and had a thin layer of foam – the barista is good. rif’s latte (RM11) was equally as good; not overly foamy yet silky from the steamed milk. VCR uses two types of beans; Coffex and Artisan. Coffex is used for milk based drinks like my flat white and his latte, to give them a chocolate-y, smoother finish. This came as a surprise, because I’ve had coffees (both flat white and latte) made using Coffex and they didn’t taste this good. I guess it boils down to technique and skills, plus the baristas take a bit longer to prepare the coffee so timing is probably another key factor as to why the coffee is this good. I do hope VCR keeps this up as I like their values and key direction of serving good quality coffee in a cosy environment. By the way, you must try the Peanut Butter Banana Chocolate Cake (RM12 per slice) when you’re there. There’s a reason why it’s labelled “The King” at the cake counter. It was moist and fairly dense with a layer of fresh banana slices and chocolate at the centre, and topped with a delicious peanut butter frosting. It’s a pity I work nearby, yet can’t find a long enough lunch hour to sit down for a cuppa until yesterday. Now that I know VCR is such a gem, it is worth pushing my afternoon meetings (or at least try) to after 2pm just so I can enjoy a cup every now and then!",4.5,503,Cafe,Coffee N Tea,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

LOKL Cafe instagrammable interior and on-point brunch vibes are something that we love, all time, other than their Buttermilk Chicken Waffle with Apple Cider. Back and chilled out at LOKL Coffee on  the first week of 2018 second half, sipping on lovely coffee while immersing ourselves in the liveliness of this cafe. Weekend for LOKL Coffee is busy, easily full house by 10AM. Do come early to avoid waiting. Big Breakfast, Summer Pasta with Smoked Chicken, Beetroot Pesto Pink Pasta, Smoked Brisket Hash, Granola Bowl, Breakfast Salad, Green Smoothie Bowl, Smoked Salmon & Scrambled Eggs with Broccoli, Thai Breakfast Omelette, Truffle Croque Madame, Smoked Salmon & Cheese Bagels, Frittata, etc..- LOKL Coffee Co menu offers both popular selections and dishes incorporated with creativity. Like our Kaya Butter Toast but with interesting Western twist, replacing Hainanese bread with fluffy, buttery brioche, and salted caramel jam instead of kaya. Oatmeal Waffles with Bananas, honey pecans, gula Melaka syrup RM17– another East meets West dish, on the sweet sides. We hardly eat walnuts but this toasted version goes really well with banana and the syrup! Coffee menu in LOKL Cafe are thoughtfully divided into Western Coffee and Local Coffee, where the former is more of the hipster thirdwave style like latte, cappuccino, americano; while the latter is a great option to introduce to tourists about our traditional coffee – the famous Kopi O and Kopi Susu. But if you aren’t into coffee, Orange Juice, Apple Carrot Ginger, Coconut Cucumber Lime, Spiced Watermelon & Mint, Passion Fruit Soda, Ice Lemon & Ginger Rooibos Tea, English Breakfast Tea, Green Tea, Cammile, Peppermint Tea are some of the alternative you can have.",4.5,679,Cafe,Coffee N Tea,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,
133,Niko Neko Matcha 1.5 - Bangsar,11.00 AM - 5.30 PM,"82A Lorong Maarof, Kuala Lumpur 59000 Malaysia",+60 11-5648 2490,https://www.nikonekomatcha.com/,info@antipodeancoffee.com,"Probably the only brand associated with matcha that I can recognise immediately nowadays - today I’m reviewing Niko Neko Matcha (their actual shop lot) in Bangsar! Came here with my 2 sisters because they saw it a lot on Instagram. I’ve tried other things by them, including The Tokyo Restaurant’s Matcha Cheesecake and FROZEN by Ken’s matcha single scoop ice cream (but I believe this was just them using their powder rather than a proper collaboration). In general, I’m a fan! It is located on a row of shops in Bangsar! What I would say is that parking here is an absolute nightmare. The reason is that there is a really narrow lane - one way, so do look out for the direction of traffic - for parallel parking on the row parallel to the shops and another row that is just absolutely full nearly all the time. But basically you want to look out for their sign (which you’ll see throughout this blogpost) on that row of shops! Do be wary because it is actually a really small shop on the second floor. You’ll walk up the stairs and be confused why there is a locked office-esque door which someone has to buzz you in. Then you’ll see a flower shop and another door with the Niko Neko sign before heading in! But my personal advise is, don’t eat/drink here unless absolutely necessary. It’s one thing that this is a pretty cafe/shop lot, but it’s absolutely another thing that there is like an absolute sea of people in there. Quite small in general, and they do sell other things like their powder itself and a lot of technical tools for you to make your own drinks at home! We had the Matcha Extremist Latte (Ren Matcha) for RM13, the Chubkies Matcha White Chocolate Cookie for RM6 and the Mokureb Crunch Cube for RM6. The Chubkies Matcha White Cookie is just basically their cookie! I’ll get into the taste in a bit, but what I’ll have to say about the Matcha Extremist Latte is that once I finished it and opened the cup, I almost feel a bit scammed. They legitimately have a gigantic ice cube that takes up let’s say 75% of the cup (and this is post drinking, please note). I wish I took a picture, but do take a look if you get it and you’ll see what I mean. If you talk about what’s worth the money, I would say that the cookie is just about worth it, but the Mokureb Crunch Cube really isn’t worth RM6 in my eyes. REALLY small cube that I find really hard to justify for that price - and as I mentioned above, I’ll get into the taste shortly. All those things aside, I really like the matcha they use. You can’t deny that there is a reason why their matcha powders are popular in pretty much everything they are used in. The Matcha Extremist Latte is REALLY rich, tasty and refreshing. Kinda almost reinforces the idea that good matcha isn’t meant to be sweet because it really shows in this drink with its pure flavour. Honestly a really big fan of the drink. Big ice cube aside, I almost wouldn’t suspect that there would be such a big ice cube inside from just drinking it because it is so tasty. Next up, the cookie! Quite simply a really yummy cookie that I feel pretty much most people will enjoy. Simple, tasty and just all around really nice to eat! The filling inside using their YURI Matcha is just SO GOOD! For their crunch cube (which I pinched a picture off of the Niko Neko Instagram page), I feel as though you definitely have a lot of flavour in there! I believe there is even a version whereby you can get a set of 3 for RM16, but being so small, it just becomes a little bit hard to justify. But I guess good to try for the simple fact that it is new and it is pretty yum - I won’t deny what I personally think!",5,213,Cafe,Coffee N Tea,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

135,103 Coffee Workshop,8.00 AM - 10.00 PM,"Lot 103, Jalan Radin Bagus, Kuala Lumpur 57000 Malaysia",+60 3-9547 9779,https://www.facebook.com/103coffeeworkshop/,103coffeeworkshop@gmail.com,"Among all the cafes in Sri Petaling I’ve reviewed, this one sprung the most surprises. 103 Coffee Workshop is located on the same row with several other cafes, including being just beside Soft Serve. This particular café serves Japanese fusion food that has been creatively thought up by the team behind the café. The first surprise sprang when I opened the heavy sliding door to enter. It was packed to the brim! Granted I came on a Sunday afternoon for lunch, but I was not prepared for a crowd this size. Almost every seat was taken and we were shown to the last two seats available. Thankfully it was in a cozy corner at the back of the café. Even when filled to the brim, 103 Coffee Workshop allows you to feel like you have your own space. Seats are not too close together, and somehow it works. I loved the décor, especially the use of cement finishing on the walls, and the little touches here and there with sweet looking ceramics and knick knacks. Even the table numbers were artfully done on expired tin cans that were really heavy. Each table comes with a complimentary bottle of water so you don’t have to feel embarrassed or trouble yourself asking for plain water to balance out your coffee or beverage. Their menu is pretty original and impressive. Right off the bat you have the various coffees, as well as teas and non-coffee beverages like green tea lattes. For a healthier choice, there are fruits juice mixtures called Smoshies. Coffee and other drinks are priced between RM 13 – RM 18 depending on whether you want it iced or not. The main dishes on offer include several sub-groups. There are the Donburis which are rice bowls. There’s also Udon, appetizers, sandwiches and pasta. Main dishes range from RM17 to RM36. Appetizers are slightly cheaper at less than RM10. I settled for a Spam sandwich (oh I forgot to add that the place is non-halal) and hubby ordered the Yasai Itame Don or vegetable rice bowl. I got a Maneki Onigiri on the side because I was feeling peckish too. For something sweet, we ordered a glass of Earl Grey Iced Chocolate. If you didn’t already know, Earl Grey is a pretty mild tea that blends Bergamot orange, lime and other refreshing herbs with back tea leaves. This means that it has a fresh lemony flavour. The drink was the first to arrive and although it looked exactly like iced chocolate, it tasted completely different. You could distinctly taste the Earl Grey tea; really delicious and a completely new experience for me. The next main dishes were the Spam sandwich and Yasai Itame Don. I should mention that all their dishes are visually stunning, which is a truly Japanese characteristic. The Spam sandwich can with in-house fries that were a mixture of potato and sweet potato. The fresh vegetables in the sandwich provided a crunchy texture that really evened out the salty properties of the Spam. The Yasai or vegetable don was topped with carrots, mushrooms and a wobbly egg that tastes best if mixed into the rice. If you’ve ever had Cantonese ‘Mun Fan’ or ‘Mui Fan’, this don tasted uncannily like that. The small salmon onigiri was okay, but I wished the shredded omelette that came with it was a little too sweet. Great new cafes are popping up all over KL, stretching even to the far reaches of the city. 103 Coffee Workshop recently opened a new outlet in Cheras Selatan, new territory for me, and I was happy to have the chance to explore a new part of our fair capital. 103 Coffee Workshop C180, as it’s known, offers all-day Japanese brunch and a full menu that is Asian fusion, with some Thai, some Western, and some Japanese influences. Head Chef Rudy, one-quarter Japanese by ancestry, likes the delicate flavor and color of Japanese cuisine. You can see this popping up in many of the dishes that grace the menu. Take, for instance, the Yuzu Pizza (RM16.90). This unique pie starts with a thin glaze of yuzu mayonnaise on a wheat tortilla. The little bit of citrus is a nice complement to the toppings, sesame-karaage pork, kizami nori and bonito flakes. This may seem more Japanese than not, but the addition of a mozzarella-cheddar blend brings this right back into the land of international cuisine. I just put it right back into my tummy! Off the pasta menu, the Buta Yaki Salted Egg Yolk Pasta (RM20.90) pulls together spaghetti with Japanese-style gingered pork slices and curry leaves. Under cover of shaved salt, runny egg, and heavy chili, this dish packs a power punch to the taste buds. A dusting of sour plum powder adds just a hint of sweet tang. Part of 103’s mojo includes regular competition among the kitchen staff for new experimental combinations. The winners of these friendly contests generate new menu items every two months or so. This is good news for patrons who like novelty and variety. One example of this exciting fusion is the Asian Green Pesto Pasta with Sweet Thai Chili Chicken. Lemongrass creates a citrusy pesto that’s fresh and flavorful, and combines nicely with the chili sauce on the chicken. Although it’s named the Daimanzoku Kai, or Japanese Big Breakfast (RM 28.90), I think a better name might be FEAST! Generous portions of sausage, seaweed scramble, karaage chicken skewers, three types of salad, a rice cake and more create a meal for king. Not only is this is an excellent choice for guests who want to share, it also offers the chance to sample many of 103’s flavors in one go. But our favorite meal for the day was Goma Yaki Udon (RM16.90). Fat noodles are sauteed in Japanese sesame sauce and topped with pickled radish, two types of grilled mushrooms (shitake and shimeji), carrot threads and chopped scallions. This one had us fighting over the last bites on the plate. With all of this food variety, it might be easy to forget that the name of this cafe is COFFEE Workshop. Shelley is the head barista at 103 Coffee Workshop and the creativity seen on the food menu extends to the java bar as well. The Strawberry Latte (RM 14.50) begins with a whole strawberry crushed into milk with a little sugar at the bottom of the cup before adding a flask of espresso. The result is cold and refreshing, while retaining a dense coffee flavor with a little fruity flair. The more conventional Flat White (RM12.90) starts with a double shot of ristretto espresso and adds a line of milk. The finish is smooth and a little smoky. For a more Asian bent, guests can try the Matcha Latte (RM13.90), creamy sweet green tea. For those looking for interesting brews, 103 Coffee Workshop offers three options for preparing small batch single-origin coffees: Chemex, Aeropress and Pour over. Prepared in a Kalita beaker-style filter, we sampled the Kenya Kirura AA with its overtones of blackcurrant candy and a black tea finish: Aromatic and delicious. You’d expect the desserts at a cool coffee cafe to be a highlight and you won’t be disappointed by what you find here. The Banana Toffee Waffle (RM21.90) tops a crispy waffle with banana chocolate gelato. Tasty enough right there perhaps, but then they add caramelized banana and honey jackfruit for extra sweetness. Sprinkle peanut crumble and bits of banana rum toffee on top and you’ve got an effect that is close to perfection for banana lovers. And while I do love banana, maybe not as much as macadamia! The only thing I can say about the Macadamia Affogato (RM18.90) is Fab Fab Fab! A piece of rich chocolate toffee is adorned with macadamia gelato, baptized with espresso, and then crowned with cornflakes for a bit of crunch. I know it’s cliche to say something like “I thought I’d died and gone to heaven”, so let me say instead that Monica had to hold me back from licking the bowl. Cafe treasure hunters are always on the lookout for new places to drop a joe, but any intrepid soul looking for new territories to explore in KL should program their GPS to Cheras Selatan for novelty of food and location.",4,37,Cafe,Coffee N Tea,static/restaurant_pics/103 Coffee Workshop.jpg,,

Rich & robust, perking up commuters & city workers since December 2014. Quote-of-the-day stickers on the coffee cups may vary from customer to customer. Quite a sizeable selection for a rather small space - everything from espressos (RM5.90) to hot chocolates (RM7.90) to mochas, vanilla lattes & salted caramel lattes (RM8.90 for hot) for the steady stream of patrons. Customers can also take away snacks - the pandan lamingtons are completely satisfying, well-balanced in taste & texture, well-priced for RM3 each. Brownies, pastries & sandwiches might be available, if they're not already sold out in the afternoon. Only a five-minute walk from the office where we worked last year; it's too late for us to enjoy the caffeine here regularly, but we're hopeful The Optimist Coffee - which seems to be an independently run business - will open more outposts eventually. The opening of The Optimist Coffee definitely benefits us more, as it gets more convenient to reach for a good cup of coffee, reasonably priced below RM10. Expect to hear more good feedback from customers over their coffee. Currently, beverage starts from RM5.90 for espresso and black, RM7.90 for white including café latte and cappuccino, add another RM1 for flavoured coffee such as Hazelnut latte, Salted Caramel Latte, Mocha and so on.

I've stopped my step decided to take a try! The quality of the food were as good as their coffee. It was an unforgettable experience during my first visit to Jamaica Blue Cafe at gold coast. Never thought that this time I'v been invited by Jamaica Blue Malaysia to have a food review at GMBB, The Robertson, KL. It was my pleasure to attend for my 2nd visit to Jamaica Blue in Malaysia. Thanks for having my family and me in the house. Jamaica Blue has thrived despite the extremely competitive food retail market with two simple beliefs that guided them to everything that they’ve done: a belief in sourcing, roasting and preparing the very best coffee; and a belief in using only fresh, locally-sourced ingredients. They serve only 2 types of coffee beans – Jamaica Blue Signature Blend and Jamaica Blue Mountain. I'm hooked with Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee which is consider one of the world's best coffees. It's taste mild and perfectly balanced. OMG~ this is so delicious! The coffee is sweet with crisp finish when I took a sip of it. One of the world’s superior coffee-growing regions!

138,Aku Cafe & Gallery,11.00 AM - 8.00 PM,"No. 8 1st Floor, 50000 Jalan, Kuala Lumpur 50000 Malaysia",+60 3-2857 6887,http://www.oldchina.com.my/aku.html,None,"Ms. Yin Wah, the owner of Aku Cafe Gallery was once an office staff, working from 9 to 6, five days a week. The work piling in front of her never comes to an end, until one day, she started to think: Why am I so busy? Why peoples around me are so busy? Are they happy? Am I happy with my life? She began to reset her mindset, asking herself what she actually wants. In the end she decided to quit her job, and moved on to a whole new world -running a small business named Aku Cafe and Gallery, a place where you can find calm and tranquility. To her, the world is so sick. Many peoples are living in one dimensional life, busy and stressed out. This has bring her the motivation to open this cafe, aiming to provide a place for people to lay back, and relax. Located along Jalan Panggong, Aku Cafe & Gallery is quite hidden but once we pushed the door in during our visit last Sunday, we felt the quietness and calmness filling the air, a big contrast to the hustle and bustle of city outside. The entire space was more spacious than we initially thought of, with wooden tables lining up in the center of corridor-like hall space. Examined in details, vintage elements such as antique vase, fan, chairs, cupboard, cushion came in sight to conclude the furnishing, bringing us back to decades of a century. A combination of present and past. Since the main focus of the cafe is to provide a cozy environment for relax, the menu is kept simple with coffee, tea and light bites such as cakes and sandwiches. Nonetheless, everything is carefully prepared, and the hand brewed coffee here is definitely noteworthy. For hot drinks, diners can have mocha yigacheffee, gold top mandheling, coffee blend, and espresso. Hand brewed or siphon method can be chosen to prepare your coffee, priced RM8 to RM12.If you are not a coffee lover, they do have earl grey, lemon, English breakfast, lemongrass and honey lemon tea to choose from. Brewed using yigacheffee, a mocha coffee beans grown in a sub region of Sidamo in Southern Ethiopia, our Mocca Yigacheffee coffee carries a smooth, light fruity notes. For cold drinks, we liked their iced drip coffee. Other choices including Iced Coffee, Iced Coffee Blend, Mint Iced Coffee and Lemon Iced Coffee. It is always great to have a piece of cake to go with coffee and tea. Cake choices here aren’t extensive, but all handmade with quality to give the best to customer. We tried out chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream and ginger honey. Very dense and thick chocolaty flavour with bites of nuts for extra texture, good but a tad too dry. The vanilla ice cream topping over came in just right to give some moisture,  compensating the dry texture. Continued on we had Aku Special Cake for Coffee. Soft and spongy, very much like a enhanced version of butter cake with unknown secret ingredients, sided with creamy sauce made from fruits. As the name called, the cake was meant to be paired with coffee, so we found that it was on sweeter side, turned just perfect when the sweetness was toned down by the bitterness of coffee. If you were here with hungry stomach and seeking for hot dishes, you would be disappointed with the limited choices available. Hainan toast and sandwiches are all you can find on the menu. Anyhow, the cafe is trying to bring out more varieties such as spaghetti. Hot and complicated dishes would not be available near future, seeing that she and another staff are the only two persons there to take down the order, brew coffee, prepare food and receive payment. Simple tossed pasta may be the most complete meal you will get in Aku Cafe & Gallery soon, such as this hand tossed spiral pasta brimming with texture from chewy pasta, crunchy crushed penuts, juicy onions and creamy dressing. Overall is good with heavy onion flavours mingled within, great for onion lovers. In short, what makes the cafe special besides the good coffee and relaxing ambience? – The occasionally screening of movie directed by Tsai Ming Liang, the Malaysian born director who has won numerous film festival awards and with films acclaimed worldwide.

139,Q Cup cafe,8.00 AM - 6.30 PM,"72, Jalan Imbi, Kuala Lumpur 55100 Malaysia",+60 3-2113 0320,https://www.facebook.com/qcupcafe,info@antipodeancoffee.com,"Step inside Q Cup Cafe and you’ll find a charming cafe that unabashedly professes its love for coffee. Coffee art lines the walls; there's a counter full of coffee bean samples (take a whiff!); and with a cheerful proclamation sitting on the countertop, you’ll also discover that the cafe won a local tournament award this year for its espresso. This coffee roaster & cafe takes coffee seriously, so that customers can enjoy a satisfying cup, thanks to its primary founder Yu Tack Yuen. Yu's passion for coffee literally knows no borders; he has travelled to plantations in Central America for great beans, meeting farmers to explore the process of cultivation. He has a good heart too, making an effort through his sourcing choices to support the livelihoods of impoverished coffee-growing communities in countries like Honduras. And his determination to offer the best coffee is conveyed through a coveted Panamanian varietal that Q Cup secured by bidding in an online auction. So naturally, we have to start with caffeine: Providing the foundation for the Best Espresso title at the Malaysia Open Barista Championship 2017, the Ethiopia Sidamo Bensa G3 Natural (RM22) is a single origin that promises a pleasurably intense fruitiness, naturally balanced in acidity and sweetness. Try it both black and white to experience evolving facets of this coffee. And from the highlands of Panama, specifically the family-run Hacienda La Esmeralda estate, comes a Geisha that’s reputedly ranked among the world’s best (RM60 for a pot that’ll suffice for two or three patrons). This limited-availability micro-lot coffee is not something you’ll chance on in a lot of places, so it’s worth sipping it here for a soothingly structured coffee that might make your afternoon. You can also opt for fun beverages a Cappuccino Freddo (RM15), Chilled Valrhona Chocolate (RM18) or vanilla-loving Snow White (RM19). Tea lovers aren’t neglected either, with the French Hediard Superior Earl Grey Tea (RM18) furnishing a distinctive, delicate brew. We were pleasantly surprised by Q Cup’s food menu, recently expanded to supply more options than ever before, many of them relatively unique in KL’s landscape of cafes. The Pomegranate Salad Bowl (RM18) is lovely, brimming with light, green goodness, modest with the dressing. Order a few starters to share - the Crab Pate on Sliced Baguette (RM18 for three slices) is a snack that’s rich in crustacean creaminess, while the Pan-grilled Tuna with Mango Salsa on Puff Pastry (RM24) is an interesting combination of the fishy and the fruity, with the pastry breaking apart easily in your mouth. Here for brunch? No problem - the Turkey Ham Pan-Grilled Cheese Sandwich (RM18) oozes with cheese, layered with ham, packed into fresh bread that Q Cup bakes itself (no shortcuts here!). The Chicken Sausage and Scrambled Eggs (RM18) come with a bagel for a tender chew, with the sausage proving juicy and savoury while the well-portioned eggs are nicely fluffy. Hot meals are also available, crossing continents with ease. Q Cup offers a tapas menu that originates from its wine bar upstairs, with plenty of options like the classic Spanish Gambas al Ajillo (RM26), or garlic shrimp with herbs, slightly spicy and altogether addictive. Asian temptations are represented by the likes of Japanese Curry Rice with Deep-fried Prawns (RM26; crunchy breaded prawns with rice and a sweetish, richly satisfying mild curry), and Portobello Mushrooms Stuffed with Chicken Paste (RM20), which might evoke some interpretation of yong tau foo. We’re still not done yet: It’s fairly impressive to see how quality and care is extended through Q Cup’s entire repertoire, which also includes European-inflected mains. The very hearty Ratatouille with Puff Pastry (RM19) is an interesting way to bring crisp textures to the moist heap of the beloved French vegetable stew (vegetarians will be happy to note that they’re not treated as an afterthought here). For omnivores, order the the Italian Breaded Chicken (RM28), a juicy leg, scattered with breadcrumbs for yet another thoughtful twist, partnered with fried turmeric rice pilaff for a can’t-fail protein-and-carb partnership. Desserts display a sense of uniqueness too, from a surprisingly presented Honey Toast (RM15) with mixed fresh fruits to the meticulously crafted Strawberry Lover (RM20; a croissant bowl with Q Cup's own-made vanilla ice cream, custard and strawberries) and Mango Churros (RM23), pairing churros with thinly sliced mangoes that leave a memorable impression. Note that Q Cup is more than a cafe; upstairs, there’s a cosy wine bar with a cool selection that stretches from Japan to New Zealand - suitable for mellow catch-up sessions or even business dinners. Coffee tasting sessions and brewing workshops are also offered - check out Q Cup’s Facebook page for their schedule.",4.5,46,Cafe,Coffee N Tea,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Hit into my safe list that I have done over weeks and saw this interesting place that my friend have shared in insta and decided to check them out. Only found out that Common Man Coffee Roasters (CMCR) is quite an establish brand in Singapore has now landed in KL at TTDI’s Plaza Vads. Coffee here are pretty amazing as my latte do give a very nice slight acidic taste yet gives you a nice burst of aroma after taste. Ice Cappuccino is rather interesting too as the first sip with give you a punch of unique taste that later will flow down your throat with the after taste. Lovely blend. Organic Egg Benedict @ RM 38 – Tender braised Ox Cheeks, Two poached organic eggs & chive hollandaise with honey rye or multigrain bread (we chose multigrain). Love this little mischievous presentation as the rockets covers the ingredient in it and as you break it, you are greeted with the braised ox cheese which is soft, juicy and a great combination with the little spices on the top and the oozy yolk that gives you a nice balance of flavour. As I am a sucker for brioche bread as it is hard to find a nice one. Fluffy Brioche French Toast @ RM 27 – berries compote, maple syrup & premium vanilla ice cream. I have to say this is one of the best brioche that I have had so far in KL. Every single bite is crisp at the side and it is soft and fluffy in the middle bread base. Maple syrup is not too sweet yet match well with the berries compote that brings you the little acidity of the flavour. Simple and it is a masterpiece. Worth to order this to share. As I bump into my best friend at the same morning, he highly recommended Turkish Common Man Breakfast, as he loves the combination of flavour and at least it is something different. The Grilled Juicy Chilli Boneless Chicken was delicious. You’d get two large strips/slices of boneless grilled chicken, topped with chilli/tomato puree? I am not too sure about the puree, it provided plenty of flavor and heat but not to an extent that is overwhelmingly hot that it sets your tongue burning. The chicken were grilled perfectly – retaining the tender and juicyness. I enjoyed every bite of it. The dish also comes with a side of crushed avocado salsa, salad and caramelized lemon. Overall, a satisfying dish although I cant comprehend the fact that this dish cost me almost 40 ringgit. Hmmm. The CMCR Fish Burger, I loved. It was really good. The patty consisted of tilapia fillet + mash potato, which I thought was an awesome combo. The mash acted like a glue, kept the whole fish patty together and it also provided the patty with a rather unusual texture. The taste, the flavors were awesome.",4,71,Cafe,Coffee N Tea,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,
141,The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf,7.30 AM - 7.00 PM,"Lot C3.01.00, Level 3 Pavilion 168 Jalan Bukit Bintang, Kuala Lumpur Malaysia",+60 3-2110 4689,https://www.coffeebean.com.my/,None,"CBTL is an American coffee chain, similar in style to Starbucks. In Malaysia they sell a range of coffees and teas, hot and iced, plus have a small selection of cakes and do a few cooked meals, usually takes on local food. The coffee is more bitter than most of these big US chains, which makes it very good for mocha. They also claim to have a proprietary ice maker, which means the ice in their cold drinks comes in 6mm by 3mm doughnuts. The stores are usually pretty comfortable, though the free-standing stalls are normally a bit more cramped. Nice enough for a fairly expensive coffee – we visit quite a lot, I suppose. The food is also a bit expensive for what you get, so it’s a bit of a last resort for us. We have tried a berry tart – good fruit, which surprised us, glazed on an artificial cream filling of an OK pastry base. Quite expensive at RM17, though we got a discount. Fiancee reckoned the salmon spaghetti aglio olio wasn’t very tasty, but did at least have some frsh spring onions. The half boiled eggs seemed in part microwaved, which seemed a little odd, and the slices of not quite toast to accompany it were OK…no idea who puts jam on this, though. Recently, they have expanded their menu in certain locations to include few more hot meals, such as a chicken banh mi, which wife thought was reasonable (it has traditionally Malaysian, rather than Vietnamese, flavours such as chicken floss). I went for the vegetarian pizza with chillies. On a tortilla base, it was surprisingly good, with a sweetish sauce and decent toppings. Start off with the Opah Rendang Pie (RM14.80), with traditional chicken rendang baked into a yummy crust, or the smoky, chargrilled Per-chick Sandwich (RM20.50), oozing with creamy percik sauce and layered with slices of hard-boiled eggs for a truly hearty meal. To wash it down, savour the exotic Turkish Mocha as an Ice Blended® drink (small RM16.50, regular RM18), hot or iced latte (small RM16, regular RM17.50), or cold-brewed (small RM12.80, regular RM13.80), for a more intense caffeine kick. For a light, clean finish, try whole-leaf Wakoucha Mariko tea (RM9.60 per cup, RM12.50 per pot) with its smooth, woody notes. Finally, what’s a meal without dessert? Fans of The Straits cake will rejoice as this all-time favourite makes a comeback – don’t miss the chance to enjoy this fluffy pandan cake laced with Gula Melaka, cream and mascarpone cheese (RM12.95 per slice, RM55 for petite, RM129.30 for a whole cake). For chocolate lovers, it can only be The 72%, a luscious 72% dark chocolate cake with layers of almonds and pralines (RM15.95 per slice, RM159 for a whole cake). For more petite bites, try The Sea Salt Mac (RM10), a chunky soft cookie stuffed with dark chocolate and macadamia nuts, Sour Cherry Muffin (RM7.50 or RM13 with a small cup of Today’s Brew/Hot Tea), full of tart, luscious cherries, or the yummy The Raya Cookie (RM10). Last but not least, check out the elegant new Tétouan tumblers in black or white (RM78) – the perfect accessory to carry along! I have one now and am sooooo in love with it.",4,123,Cafe,Coffee N Tea,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,
142,"J.Co Donuts, Coffee and yogurt",10.00 AM - 10.30 PM,"Off Bukit Bintang, Kuala Lumpur 50200 Malaysia",+60 3-2141 7761,https://www.jcodonuts.com/id/en,info@antipodeancoffee.com,"Gone are the days where enjoying doughnuts were quite a mundane tea time. But it’s no longer the case here as you could expect more whimsy ideas that come with this seemingly ubiquitous bakery at J.CoDonuts & Coffee, Pavillion KL. Am pretty sure the idea of slurping in an icy cold beverage coupled with some delectable crafted donuts especially on a sultry afternoon is almost irresistible to anyone. What’s more if it comes salubriously enjoyable without jeopardizing your health regime? This sounds too good to be true treats could actually be easily relished over here at J.Co Donuts &Coffee, Pavillion KL, for these spongy haloes bites prepared over here is real fluffy and most importantly not oily at all! The brand takes pride in using only the freshest and best ingredients from all over the world such as Belgian Chocolates, Californian Almonds, Japanese Matcha Green Tea and Italian roasted coffee to pamper the growing discreet gourmands nowadays. That way foodie could really savour these awesome spread without being much guilt-ridden I suppose. This cozy yet chic café which caters patrons from all walks of life, offers customers a wide array of delightful doughnuts that are freshly made daily and innovatively, together with fantastically whips up special beverages from time to time too. And if you are a frequent visitor to this mall, you would have noticed that this cafe is often crowded with ardent foodies, deliberating which tempting ring-shaped fried cakes to be brought home. One of the many highlights here would be the Caffe Avocado, which would be launched very soon on this coming 24th March 2014. Available in the size of Uno (MYR 11), Due (MYR 12) and Tre (MYR 13), Caffe Avocado offers a healthier alternative, as compared to the common coffee frappe by its coffee competitors. It pampers your palate with a hint of refreshing green, amidst the slightly sweet and smooth finish. It is subtle yet complex but at the same time, plays well with other ingredients such as dark chocolate and cappuccino in this case. It is also cheerfully spiced up with sprinkles of dark chocolate that gladly does not overpower the avocado taste. Great job! What’s the best companion for this luscious blended beverage other than the fruit itself? And we have the Avocado Dicaprio- adequately coated avocado cream donuts, with some sprinkles of dark chocolate on the ring. Trust me, the chocolate is such an enjoyable tickler to have, and pairs really well with the avocado cream, similarly goes for the drinks too. No wonder it remains the top pick of Afad; the Manager of Branding & Marketing division. As you get to know him better, you would realize this young chap is really an engaging visionary person. Equally aromatically blended is the Mocha Espresso Frappe, that is made of a lovely marriage between chocolate and coffee, doused with some smidgen of coffee powder. Fret not to those who might worry if the coffee taste is stronger as the mocha has indeed beautifully injected some chocolaty sensation to it, making it a balanced indulgence without overly sweet. Another must-try beverage from J.Co Donuts &Coffee. For the suggested complementary candidate for this cuppa, it is perfect to go along either with Black Jack or Forest Glam (foreground).  A decadent dark chocolate-coated donut, that is simply indulging and humbly enriched with fruity berries on the top. If these might appear bit sinful to the small eaters, then perhaps getting some mini bites would be the better deal? Consider the J. Pops Baby Donuts which is available in 24 pieces at just a retail price of MYR 18 per box. You could mix and match them from 12 varieties adorably. One of the best and affordable froyo in town, where it won’t actually burn a hole in your pocket, yet get to enjoy a healthier dessert, compared to ice cream. It has the similar pleasing velvety texture that comes with the unmistakably citrusy sourness that is very light to your palate. When tops up with some peach dices, it makes a very appealing combination that you would be craving scoops after scoops. I must say that the fruit toppings are really fresh and juicy, with the milky frozen yogurt is 100% fat-free as the quality yogurt is sourced all the way from New Zealand itself. You could even opt for a take-away froyo with this J. Cool To Go package at MYR18 per box. This special innovated container would ensure your froyo stay handsomely frozen till you reach the fridge. J.Co Donuts & Coffee surely scores points for its feel-good casualness and for keeping its recipes relatively simple and interesting with finest assortments. In a nutshell, this bright and chirpy café makes an ideal place for those seeking casual hang out over the table with buddies or just merely unwinding oneself, paired with its homey and loveable ring-shaped pastries. No wonder this place remains the favourite spot for many expatriates as well as locals here.",4,225,Cafe,Coffee N Tea,"static/restaurant_pics/J.Co Donuts, Coffee and yogurt.jpg",,

This is especially seen during the afternoon tea session. With the table overlaying with fine bone china of teapot, teacups and saucers, plates and all other utensils. Time for a fake tai-tai session and this time we had it in The Tea Lounge in Majestic Hotel KL. Furnished with old fashioned grid ceilings with posh looking chandelier, comfortable arm chairs and sofa, old school vintage tiles, soft lighting from the table lamps and along with the pianist playing harmony and classy melodies on his grand piano, The Tea Lounge creates such a perfect setting for English Afternoon Tea with a Malaysian twist. Majestic Hotel’s afternoon tea is served between 3 to 5 pm daily. You may choose to spend your afternoon in different areas namely The Tea Lounge, Atrium at the Colonial Café, The Drawing Room and The Orchid Conservatory with price comes at Rm 48++ for the first 2 areas, Rm 68++ and Rm 88++ respectively. It’s always crowded during the weekend; do make a call in advance to avoid disappointment especially The Orchid Conservatory where seats are limited. How I wish I have joined the girls in The Orchid Conservatory before the readjustment of the price, those orchids are so pretty! Comes with a wide range of sweets and savouries; served on the elegant three-tier beautiful stand and a pot of house-blend BOH tea. If you love to have Ronnefeldt tea, you can always top up Rm 30+ for a change. They offer a variety of Ronnefeldt tea ranging from black, green, herbal and fruits tea. We’d topped up for a pot of Irish Whiskey Cream Tea. Simply love it as it this black tea was loaded with whiskey and cocoa aroma. The selection of sweets and savouries were pretty good. Firstly, it came with the tier stand that filled up with finger sandwiches such as smoked salmon, tuna, cucumber cheese, and two types of scones, plain and raisin. Not to mention some sweets such as banana toffee tart, pavlova, cheese cake, panna cotta and many more. Later on, we were served with savouries that were infused with Malaysian flavours like deep fried potato cheese ball, beancurds and savoury pies. I love the idea they kept the deep fried food warm in the copper container, how considerate! However, scones were a letdown. They were rather dry and lack of buttery taste.",4,74,Cafe,Coffee N Tea,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

For starters, if you’re Waze-ing your way here, look for Calvary Convention Centre (CCC) in Bukit Jalil. This is actually a church which doubles up as an events space. They have several commercial lots and two of these have been filled up with eateries. You’ll have to pass by a security guard house, so just tell them you’re going in for the café and they’ll let you in with no fuss. To be honest, this is really one of my favourite cafes in the entire Klang Valley. Once you walk into the church compound you’ll know what I mean. What you’ll notice first are the perfectly manicured lawns with a completely futuristic architecture, overlooking a large golf course. This just isn’t your regular looking gothic church. In fact, you’ll probably mistake it for just another modern building. The whole setup is just so bright and cheerful. Once you locate the owl-decorated double doors, you’ll be greeted by smiling servers who seem very sure of themselves. I do need to point out that New Chapter, despite its rather obscure location, tends to be rather packed, especially at lunch time and on the weekends. They have about than 50 table and countertop seats but if you find yourself having to wait, fret not. There’s a tastefully decorated waiting area that’s really spacious. Here you can hang out with a magazine or two, while lounging on cushy pillows, all decorated with owls. The café itself is perfect for plenty of Instagrams, as there are so many picturesque corners filled with owl inspired knick knacks. Be warned that you may have to share a table if you come alone or as a pair, so cozy up peeps!The New Chapter’s menu isn’t very large. Basically, if you come in the evening for dinner, there are several kinds of pasta to choose from, as well as some Italian inspired mains like risotto and roast chicken.  I’ve also been here during lunch and I really, really recommend their Scotch Eggs. There are two variations if I remember correctly, and they’re both to die for.Anyway for this latest visit, I settled for a mushroom risotto and a mushroom Carbonara. Somehow, the hubby and I were craving some pretty familiar stuff. The food here is really exquisite and you can feel that each dish is crafted with such care and passion. There are no cutting corners here, and you’ll get the freshest and best ingredients. Most of all, every dish is so visually stunning.My mushroom risotto was comforting, and I could really taste the warm stock that it was cooked in. More importantly, everyone who comes here should try their waffles. There’s a savory smoked salmon and scrambled egg waffle for breakfast, and all day sweet waffles. I just couldn’t keep my fingers off the Milo Dinosaur waffle, which came topped with the richest chocolate ice cream ever, as well as a bunch of crunchy cereal and marshmallows.My only gripe is perhaps the prices. Pastas are priced from RM18 to RM25 while mains were about RM 20 –RM28 each. So if you’re eating for two, the bill might come up to about RM80-RM90 with drinks.",4,76,Cafe,Coffee N Tea,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

A further check on their Facebook and Instagram, we sigh with relief as they are just going through a major renovation, not ending the business. Haha.We were so anticipated, waiting for them to “returns better & bigger”. And oh WOW, Croisserie Cafe doesn’t dissapoint. Modern contemporary interior, very difference from their previous classic, normal bakery look.O’Coffee Club, an international coffee chain has opened upstairs too, linked directly to Croisserie Cafe.

Lol.Had a hard time deciding what to have. Forced ourselves to settle down these five, though we felt like having more. Price range is from RM4 onwards. Everything is delish!Cream Tart tastes wonderful as usual, and Summerkid loves their plain croissant. This is actually the first time for Summerkid to try out Croisserie Cafe, though he has seen Summergirl bought tarts and danish from here many times. Finally he changes his perception for this place. Haha.In short, we are really happy for them as they are more busy now, but at the same time a little sad – as we need to queue to get our German Tart now. Haha. Staffs are friendly too, welcome us right after we walked in, and helped us to bring our pastries upstairs. Just FYI, Croisserie are now available online now too.

Located just few doors away from Leaf & Co. Cafe at Mingle, Jao Tim can be easily missed out if you didn’t pay attention to. No obvious sign board. So spot for the doors next to Hai O Chinese Pharmacy when you are around. No. 61 to be exact. Judging from the closed doors, we initially thought that Jao Tim wasn’t in business that day. But as we carefully pushed the door and found that it wasn’t locked, and saw lights from upstairs, our mood turned from slightly disappointed to super excited. Yay! p/s: The door is meant to be closed, but cafe is in business. Hahaha.Similar to Merchant’s Lane, Jao Tim has a long stretch of staircases leading guests to cafe’s floor. The moment we finished walking up the last staircase and the cafe came in sight, we were like.. WOW, absolutely beautiful!High ceiling, exposed bricks walls, wooden floorings, wooden panels – Jao Tim maintains the charm of this century old heritage Chinatown building for raw & rustic touch, along with modern vintage elements in unique custom finishes, which manage to distinguish itself from many other cafes in Klang Valley.Spot the European style built-in-cabinet and brass accents furnitures – reminds us about Kingsman haha.Jao Tim takes the name of 酒店 (pronounce it in Cantonese you can probably read it right), as this premise used to be a hotel in early 19th century. It is now sectioned into two floors. The lower floor as cafe and the upper floor is like a space of “less is more” art – the walls, the geometric tiles and that table. Guess it will become a favourite spot for Instagrammers very soon.Jao Tim currently holds a small menu, covering coffee, tea and craft beers for beverage…..and food like Grilled Cheese Sandwich (RM15), Smoked Duck Quiche (RM16), Classic Chicken Pie (RM15), Croissant (RM7), pain au Chocolat (RM7), Chocolate Peanut Butter cake (RM14), Carrot Walnut cake (RM14), Banana Bread (RM9).We had latte and cappuccino for caffeine-fix, sharing a platter of grilled cheese sandwich – one of the best sellers in Jao Tim.Two bread slices generously sandwiched with cheese, toasted and served pipping hot. Take a deep bite and enjoy the crackling crunchiness, oozing with sinfully delicious melted cheese from the centre. Comes with a side of refreshing salad. If you love your sandwich crispy and cheesy, this could be your favourite.Overall, we love this place. Friendly service, cozy ambience, jazz music, and not so crowded yet, at least for now. However we guess it will get crowded very soon, ‘coz it is such a pretty cafe to hang out. LOL.

The top temptation here: The inventive 'banh mi' toastie, a cross between the Vietnamese sandwich & the British-beloved toasted sandwich, well-stuffed with lemongrass chicken, duck rillettes & crisp veggies in lovely bread. Each toastie is RM12. The top temptation here: The inventive 'banh mi' toastie, a cross between the Vietnamese sandwich & the British-beloved toasted sandwich, well-stuffed with lemongrass chicken, duck rillettes & crisp veggies in lovely bread. Each toastie is RM12. Grizzly serves blueberry or banana chocolate waffles with ice cream (RM15), but this office building's workers on the move might like to grab carrot & coconut cakes or chocolate chip cookies if they're in a hurry. Shortbread cookies & anzac biscuits, anyone? We see more than a few hands shoot up. Grizzly currently uses Papa Palheta's increasingly common Throwback Brazilian-Indonesian blend. Flat whites cost RM10.Priorities straight, coffee is the first order and a good strong Latte (RM11) elevates my mood. Nicely textured foam and just-the-right-temperature milk over their very own espresso blend is well-balanced. It’s an international mixture of medium-roasted Costa Rican, Sumatran and Ethiopian beans. Low-fat milk is available for those wanting to reduce the calories.Dessert for breakfast? Why not? Mochatella (RM18) starts with a Nutella base. Espresso ice cubes are added and then guests add milk (provided on the side) to their own preference. I recommend not stirring at first. Taste and then gradually stir building sweetness as desired.The food menu is kept simple for their small prep area and the items make quick and easy bites to eat in with coffee or to grab and go. Close to two handfuls of toasties, a couple of pies and a small selection of cookies, muffins and cakes just about sum it up.I’m a big fan of a toastie, so am easily pleased here. First off, Grilled Chicken Avocado Toastie (RM18) is given a liveliness with wasabi mayo. This is their most-ordered item and I can see why with the thread of heat tempered with the creamy avocado. Bread is toasted until golden furnishing an elegantly crunchy exterior while maintaining a soft spongy middle.Bringing a taste of Vietnam to Grizzly, the Lemongrass Chicken Bahn Mi (RM16) features the traditional filling of chicken breast marinated in lemongrass served with shredded carrots, daikon and spring onions. Of all the sandwiches, this one has the lightest profile. Q shares that this is his favourite.Smashed Avo and Eggs Toastie (RM15 normal RM10 petit) offers something for breakfast. I love that there is an option of petit – it’s great for a small bite or for those who like to try a few different things. The filling is an egg salad with the avocado and boiled eggs mashed together. A lightly grained (crusty cereal) sourdough is a good thickness, holding the generous filling but not making the sandwich “all bread”.Another brekkie option, Green Eggs Toastie (RM15 normal, RM10 petit) is given its verdant hue with a pesto omelette. The bread bulges with egg and cheese. The cheese is melted through giving that seductive texture associated with melty cheese. It really is a hearty portion. Light eaters might be satisfied with the petit serving of this alone as the wadding is so liberal.Carrot Cake (RM10) is a happy choice for me on most days. Knowing it comes from the Marmalade kitchen is a good predictor that it’s going to be yum. A moist cube of cake textured with shreds of veg is covered by a thin layer of cream cheese. The star though is the seductive top of crushed walnuts, pumpkin seeds and a scoop of orange marmalade on the crown.",4.5,33,Cafe,Coffee N Tea,static/restaurant_pics/Grizzly.jpg,,

Concealed behind a premium oyster bar, the entrance is a simple opening in the wall. Cool polished cement is given warmth with wooden chairs and tables. Soft downlights direct focus on the space where your meal will be placed and a chilled contemporary mix of jazzy tunes softens the air. Hibiki means echo and harmony in Japanese and we’re just about to see those words put into action with fine wines paired with an omakase menu of premium ingredients from Japan. Marcus Lai, Master of Wine candidate from Asia Wine Cellar (a fine wine importer in Singapore focusing on premium wines from France) joins the fun and has chosen vintage and non-vintage Champagnes and Burgundian wines to match Chef Saito’s menu. When quizzed about the “why” of his selection, he shares that Japan was one of the first countries in Asia to import Champagne and fine French wines, even before Hong Kong and Singapore. These fine wines match the delicate flavours of high-quality Japanese cuisine. The launch is very good. Rated the top 2018 entry Champagne by Decanter, the Andre Jacquart Vertus Premier Cru Blanc de Blancs is shiny gold in the glass with enticing aromatics of flowers and melon. The character is maintained in the palate with fruit, zest and a mild creaminess. Delicate bubbles play gently with chef’s tray of appetizers. Eaten from left to right, the Tomato Ohitashi is peeled smoothly offering a balance of tart and sweet. The Vinaigrette Japanese Oyster lifts the intensity of acidity a notch and Fried Manganji Togarashi (Japanese chilli from Kyoto) is chargrilled providing a distinctive smokiness in the mouth. Lastly, Monk Fish Liver with Narazuke (pickles from Nara known for their distinctive aroma and sweetness due to their pickling in the lees of sake) is smooth and creamy. Our next wine, Domaine Francois Gaunoux Meursault Le Clos de Tavaux 2015, comes from the most highly regarded region for Chardonnay in the world, Burgundy. Marcus attributes the elegance of this wine to the touch given by the female winemaker. He says the family owns the entire vineyard and that 2015 is a good ripe vintage. It presents a bouquet of flowers with light mineral elements and offers layers of complexity in the mouth with stone fruits and spice. Its crisp acidity complements chef’s soup and hand roll, which are about to be delivered. Chef Saito tells us that the usual way to prepare Hamaguri Clear Soup with Oriental Clam is with sake but for this evening’s pairing, he has used white wine instead. Clam stock, salt and a drop of soy sauce enhance the flavours of the mollusc and chef joyfully announces that you can now get fresh ingredients directly from Japan four times a week (when he first moved to KL it was only twice). The Caviar Hand Roll is literally handed to us as each one is made right in front of us – there is no kitchen to plate service here – it is couriered hand to hand to mouth. Chef boasts that the seafood coming from Tokyo, Kyoto and Hokkaido give him better access to ingredients than if he were living in Japan itself as product networks locally are not set up for regional coverage. So the saying that you have to visit Japan to get the best taste of the country might not necessarily hold true. Maybe you should rather consider visiting Sushi Hibiki to get the full Japanese experience….",5,92,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Decorative steel-legged tables are bordered with canary yellow chairs and topped with lanterns and ashtrays: smokers are welcome outdoors. Inside is picture perfect with the mosaic tiled floor changing in hue to blue, black and white and the same sky blue following through to painted exposed bricks. Semi-booths are made with old-school benches (that you’d usually see in a tea house) and arched sections of the wall hold stained glass, mirrored doors and quirky signage, “You can’t STOP when its laffa time.” “Casual, friendly, this is Iraqi street food,” shares Hani, restaurant owner, when commenting on what they were hoping to share with this concept. The recommended beginning is with Original Chai (RM10), a pot of hot tea with cardamom. There are a number of Iraqi teas on the menu with cinnamon, mint and milk other blends to try. For those wanting more of a caffeine kick, Iraqi Coffee (RM5), similar to a Turkish brew but with cardamom, provides a strong and heavy dose. Cold drinks include Sharbet (fresh juices RM8), Shakes (RM12), Bared (soft drinks RM4), Shnina (Iraqi yoghurt drink RM7) and Beera (beer RM15). I’m curious about all of the unknown words so order everything I’ve not heard of. It turns out the Hamedh Helo (RM8) is a sweet and sour drink of passionfruit and lime topped up with Sprite. Tarma (RM12) is a sweet and creamy milkshake blended with bananas and dates. Lastly, Shnina (RM7) feels rather nutritious with unsweetened sour Iraqi yoghurt mixed with water. The menu is well-designed resembling a single-page folded newspaper making it easy to navigate. Photographs of each dish are supposed to simplify requests but it seems to make us want to try it all rather than just select a few dishes. You can start your day at Tarma Iraqi Street Food with breakfast. Makhlama (RM16), eggs, can be served as an omelette or sunny side up and are accompanied by tomatoes, minced meat and onions. You can easily make this a veggie option by omitting the meat. It is value for money served on a big silver tray with the omelette separate from the side of pickles, tomato, cucumber and black olives. Rich picks up the tray and says, “and that’s breakfast. There’s no messing around here.”",4.5,26,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Most Korean restaurant's that I know of are non Halal and this one, being a Halal restaurant was of great interest to me as I wanted to see how authentic they could get to the real Korean food when compared to the other Korean restaurants in town that are owned by Koreans themselves. It seems that this franchise has been around for about a year now and recently they have started a re-branding exercise and their name has been changed to DubuYo. I was informed that Dubu Dubu means 'Tofu' and Yo means 'Hello'. One of their recent outlets is the one in NU Sentral Mall located on the Fourth Floor. I happened to be here this afternoon and having been aware of this outlet's presence in this mall, I did not want to miss the opportunity. The place was hard to miss. This was located on the Fourth Floor and they had one of the largest retail space in the mall. If I am not mistaken, this was directly opposite the entrance to Golden Screen Cinemas, very close to the escalators. The place was beautifully designed and had a sense of attraction to it. Along the glass panels facing the outside, mock dishes had been placed in display. This is good as it gives a newcomer a sense of what the dishes would look like. I walked up to the entrance and sadly there was no one waiting there to greet customers, despite a sign reading 'Please Wait To Be Seated'. I waited and no one came by and after about a minute, I just walked into the restaurant and that was when one of the waitress came running to me. Sad customer service. It was not even peak hours then and they should be more alert and one has got to stand at the door to usher customers into the restaurant. As a value for money proposition, they had some set lunch deals specifically for weekdays that was available from 10 am till 3 pm. These looked pretty good and were quite cheap. This is a good initiative in drawing the office crowd to come here for lunch on weekdays. I am sure that the reception for this would be good as they were all reasonably priced and very much suitable to the middle class working adults. The place had a great ambiance too and this would surely lure an even greater crowd. It was good to see the new brand DubuYo being promoted here instead of the older brand name Dubu Dubu.

Although its name means chicken ribs, there is no rib meat in dak-galbi. It is a local specialty in the Korean city of Chuncheon, Gangwon Province, where dak-galbi originated. Because of its origin, the dish is also called Chunchŏn dak-galbi. It is said that dak-galbi appeared after the late 1960s as an inexpensive anju (food that is eaten while drinking) in small taverns on the outskirts of the city to replace the comparatively expensive gui dishes, which are grilled over charcoal. The dish spread to Chunchŏn’s main districts, where the livestock industry thrives and offers fresh ingredients with no need for refrigeration. There is a street known as dak-galbi golmok (dak-galbi alley) that has a high concentration of dak-galbi restaurants. It is also a popular dish for university students on a budget, as dak-galbi is relatively cheap and served in large portions.

As a result, the Italian restaurant has overhauled its menu, and the list is very attractive.The core of the new menu at Villa Danieli is Tuscan-inspired, and the cuisine is distinctively rustic. Innovating on recipes passed down by his great grandmother, chef Roberto provides a new direction for the restaurant while maintaining its heart. As one of the oldest Italian restaurants in the city, the kitchen has seen many changes over the years, and it’s good to know the heartbeat continues. An aperitif is always an appropriate start, and the current Italian Aperol Spritz (RM 51) trend can’t be denied. Prosecco and Aperol topped up with soda is bright and easy-drinking with a balance of bitter and sweet. It serves its purpose to open the appetite and, just as well, as our first order is substantial. A brilliant beginning at Villa Danieli Sheraton Imperial KL is the Tagliere di Antipasti (2 pax, RM 135). Giving guests a taste of a little of everything, we get bruschetta, cold cuts, cheese, pickled vegetables, dried tomatoes and pizza bread all on one plate. A duo of toppings crowns the bread slices. Mozzarella, tomato and basil cap the first, and cream cheese (loads), smoked salmon and dill are found on the second. Beef pastrami, turkey ham, bresaola, Parmigiano and pecorino compose the charcuterie selections. And, lastly, antipasti in the form of olives, gherkins, artichokes and sun-dried tomatoes topped with burrata cream round-up the platter. The menu at Villa Danieli Sheraton Imperial KL is not all carbs, cold cuts and cheese; Italians place equal value on balancing out a meal with greens. Packed with fennel, black olives and peeled fresh orange segments, the Sicilian Salad (RM 26) is an excellent choice. Extra virgin olive oil is the only dressing needed, which serves to enhance the natural character of the fresh produce. When there’s a wood-fired oven in the house, it would be negligent to go without ordering pizza. There’s a page of toppings at Villa Danieli Sheraton Imperial KL, but we think it wise to go with Villa Danieli’s signature, 5 Cheese Pizza (RM 55). And, we find it, well, cheesy! Mozzarella gives stringiness; Parmesan supplies savoury bite, scamorza gifts a lovely smokiness, gorgonzola furnishes pungency and mascarpone links it all together with smooth creaminess. The palette of shades of white is broken with verdant leaves of wild rocket. By the same token, just as an essential order is pasta when it’s home-made, and the Gnocchi Alla Sorrentina Gratinati (RM 36) has my name written all over it. A meat-free recipe, these hand-shaped pillows of potato are sauced with tomato sauce, cherry tomatoes, mozzarella, smoked scamorza, sweet basil and Parmesan. Another vegetarian option at Villa Danieli Sheraton Imperial KL, hard to resist, is Risotto Zucca, Salvia, Cipolla Rossa Croccante e Carpaccio di Tartufo Estivo (RM 39). Pumpkin and sage are natural mates but add red onions, summer truffle carpaccio and crisp Parmesan, and it’s a match made in heaven (or in Italy at the very least).",4,331,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Price was not bad, over all, including 2 beers it came to around £26, which is really good value for the quality. This restaurant has very good food, the ambience is great. It is different as when you arrive they give you an iPad and you order your food and drinks off the iPad. It took a little bit to get use to especially if you make a mistake and want to cancel that meal. Although you call over the waiter and they will help you, but you also call them on the iPad. The food is presented well and it is quick. Drinks also arrive quickly, overall a very good dining experience, and you don't have to tip the iPad.",4.5,118,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Main hot buffets showcase authentic Malay dishes like Ayam Percik Iftar, Udang Galad Goreng Mamak, Gulai Lemak Telur Itik, Kurma Kerbau, Ikan Duri Berlada, Pajeri Nenas and more. The Gulai Lemak Telur Itik is fabulous… creamy and fragrant with a light hint of spices saucing up poached duck eggs simply begs for some rice. Ayam Percik Iftar is delicious with a nice nutty and spicy aroma and flavor while the Kurma Kerabu is pretty unique with a good dose of spices.

I was very excited to go to Kampung Baru after watched few Youtube videos on where to experience best Malay food in KL. I walked through the street and saw a dozen of places. The street is not very clean and can smell the sewerage which wasn’t pleasant. I had Nasi Campur with lemon ice tea and taste was good but not as amazing as expected although have to stress that still it was a good experience. Overall, I do recommend the place to visit but wish the restaurants owners would make more efforts to clean the surroundings. Kampung Baru is easy to get to taking one of the free KL circle colour buses, (check maps at hotel for your best option). Plenty of various Malay dishes and shops with nasi lemak, nasi campur, satay, juices etc. Well worth the visit for street foodies. This is a place to get traditional Malay village experience in the city center. You can find a wide range of restaurants and stalls in the area and food is good to experience. A short walk from Kampung Baru LRT station or from the Chow KIT market.Walked 15 min here from KL accommodation (Fraser Residence -see my review) as there was no budget dinner in the vicinity so we went for local, authentic, Malay food. “When in Rome, eat like the Romans” they say. Of course not a tourist attraction. You will probably be the only tourists here. xpect dirty streets and surroundings, congested one way street, many restuarants, Muslim food and seafood. This is the norm here, and popular with the locals. Found a decent family seafood restaurant (RESTORAN ENAK SaaJE) on the corner serving grilled fish and juices. The beef stew was rich, flavorsome and spicy delicious. Also enjoyed the local condiments.

All the staff are foreigners and almost afraid to talk. Most interested in setting up the tables. We ordered the BBQ Steak which was an acceptable size but slathered in thick and un tasty tomato flavoured gook. We also ordered beef stroganoff with butter rice which was stodgy with cornflour and butter rice that was slick with margarine. The meal was adorned with 2 limp pieces of asparagus.

That said, I always try to give restaurants second chances, unless the food is so awful that I can’t stomach the thought of torturing my taste buds again. It took me more than 3 years to give the banana leaf rice at Devi’s Corner in Bangsar another try. It wasn’t the food that put me off; but the poor service and their blatant attempt to overcharge me for my food. I met Dev at the Timeout KL Food Awards last year and he persuaded me to give Devi’s Bangsar another try.  The banana leaf rice at Devi’s Corner is tastier than the competitor across the road. In my opinion, the competitor’s standard has dropped tremendously since it started 10 years ago and the service is way below par. Unfortunately, the service at Devi’s Corner isn’t that much better. A staff named C.Saravanan was probably the only friendly and attentive guy at Devi’s. He was pleasant and quick on his feet so service from him was prompt. At Devi’s, you get between four to six vegetarian side dishes to go with your rice (RM7) and the curries here are very tasty. I asked for a mix of Kerala fish curry and crab curry – both were thick, richly spiced and slightly creamy from the coconut milk. It’s hard to say which is nicer, so just ask for both. The papadam I got was freshly fried; I crushed and mixed them into my curry-laden rice for a satisfying bite. I liked the mango chutney, but rif thought it didn’t go with the rice. We also shared a portion of mutton masala (RM10) and chicken 65 (RM10). I would have ordered the fried chicken (RM5) but they ran out that night. The chicken 65 was nicely marinated and tender, but portion was scant for the RM10 price tag. I counted only 6 pieces of chopped chicken. The mutton varuval was aggressively spiced and deeply flavoured, but lacked an overall roundness. That aside, the mutton pieces were tender and I enjoyed biting into the fatty bits. My banana leaf meal at Devi’s Corver was enjoyable, food-wise. Service however, needs more sprucing up – maybe Saravanan should teach his colleagues a thing or two about good working attitude.

The Extra Cheese Naan was fluffy and filled with generous amounts of cheese which was thick and ooey.  Sadly, taste wise was a bit of a let down. We felt the cheese slightly lacked flavour, not as savoury as how we thought it should be. The Dhall (RM2) on the side was thick and rick which amp up the flavours. However we felt it’s a little cut throat to charge an extra RM2 for a gravy which usually comes in a standard naan set. Nonetheless it did helped in enhancing the cheese naan. The Tandoori Chicken Breast (RM10) looked slightly different compared to what is usually served in regular mamaks. The colour was lighter and less red, which we assumed was a good thing because lesser MSG and colouring. Even the taste was different to compare to mamak’s tandoori chicken.

Rasa Utara offers a good range of Malaysian favourites, mostly from the Northern region such as daging rendang utara, ayam goreng cili lagenda and sup ekor. I really enjoyed the sup ekor utara (RM28.80) where the beef broth comes packed with flavour, from hours of cooking. The oxtail pieces were cooked till tender, and parted from the bone easily. A little steep in price, but portion is large and you get quite a bit of oxtail. For more oomph, try the Ayam Goreng Cili Lagenda (RM18.80), a Northern specialty and one of Rasa Utara’s best sellers. The chicken is cooked for a few hours in the chef’s special chilli paste, so each piece is well flavoured with spices and flavour. I also enjoyed the Ayam Kari Kapitan (RM18.80) – a classic Malaysian dish that is made with coconut milk and a blend of spices. Rasa Utara’s version packed more kick between layers of richness, and went well with Nasi Jagung (RM3.80). Another popular item at Rasa Utara is the Ikan Menari (RM38.80) where the fish is marinated and deep fried to crispy perfection, and served with sweet soy sauce and sambal to kick things up a notch. The fish is good for sharing between 3-4 pax. Terung Goreng Sambal (RM12.80) features fried brinjal slices in homemade sambal paste – simple, yet satisfying. It goes well with white rice or nasi jagung, where the latter is cooked with a blend of herbs, sweet corn, evaporated milk and raisins. It was my first time trying the Gulai Ikan Kuala Kedah (RM18.80), a Kedah specialty that combines ikan kembong with coconut milk, prawn paste, lemongrass and galangal. A bit of tamarind slice is added to cut through the richness of the santan, and I found the gravy very addictive. Rasa Utara also serves single portion dishes, like the Nasi Lemak Ayam Rendang (RM15.80), Mi Kari Udang (RM15.80) and Laksa Kedah (RM13.80). The nasi lemak comes with a whole chicken leg (rendang style), and a dollop of sambal that packs a punch. I thought the rice could be more fragrant but I generally prefer my nasi lemak richer and heavier in santan.",3.5,65,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

The world famous restaurant, co-owned by American actor Robert De Niro, first started out in 1994 in New York. It went on to win critical acclaim for its glorious dishes that were classically comforting yet creative, and chef Nobu Matsuhisa and his partners went on take the world by storm, opening more than 29 franchises over the globe. Nobu Kuala Lumpur is Southeast Asia’s first branch with dramatic 360 degree views of the KL city skyline, and its kitchen is helmed by head chef Philip Leong, brought in from Nobu Berkeley St. Born in Ipoh, Perak, Leong has worked with Nobu since 2005, starting out as a commis (basic chef) and working his way up the ladder to become the person in charge of the Kuala Lumpur kitchen. Meanwhile, general manager of Nobu KL, Stephane Heard, has plenty of experience under his belt managing the restaurant Nobu-style, having spent time with the brand’s restaurants in Las Vegas, Mexico, London, Dubai, Paris, Miami, Hawaii and Moscow. In setting up the restaurant they have worked to keep the décor stylish and trendy with lots of textured blonde wood furnishing and fixtures, but the full-length windows that offer 360-degree views of the KL city centre are the features which take the prize for most impressive. Set just one floor below Marini’s on 57 in Menara Petronas 3, diners are treated to unsurprisingly up-close views of the iconic Petronas Twin Towers. Besides that, diners also get to enjoy simple, comforting ambiance, thanks to dim lighting, a monochromatic colour palette of brown and beige, pots of greenery and wooden window blinds. Nobu’s food is unique in the fact that it is a marriage of Asian simplicity with exotic South American (specifically Peruvian) flavours, and diners can expect more than 40 cold and hot dishes on Nobu KL’s menu, with the impeccably luscious fish taking centre stage. Expect the global empire’s signature Latin-tinged dishes such as carefully carved thick slices of black cod with sweet, salty miso, Nobu’s baby corn taco shells with sashimi, soy-lacquered yellowtail with jalapeño and meaty rock shrimp tempura with creamy spicy sauce. Other standout dishes on Nobu KL’s menu include the velvety toro tartar (RM80), a savoury fatty chunk of tuna belly, topped with caviar, served with shoyu mixed with wasabi sauce. Meanwhile, the almost-obscenely lush Chilean sea bass (RM150) marinated with red jalapeño miso – at once smoky, salty and sweet in flavour – will certainly be the surefire winner of the night’s meal. An important thing to note is the fact that Nobu KL will be a halal (pork-free) restaurant, enabling it to reach a broader Malaysian market. Able to fit up to 250 people, the restaurant is divided into a dining area with sushi bar and teppanyaki grill, plus there is a lounge and club room. It is located on the 56th floor of Menara Petronas 3, adjacent to the iconic Suria KLCC; at the mall, there is an elevator beside the Versace store which links directly to the tower. On the other hand, if you are coming from Mandarin Oriental Hotel, walk towards the Cartier store, turn right and head up the elevator.",4,654,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

This will showcase chef's daily custom creation; during our visit, we had the Tsukune cheese yaki, Sawa kani karaage and Treasure bag 'hiroshi' bag. My favorite was the Sawa kani, a Japanese freshwater crab, deep fried so it was crunchy and wholly edible. Almost too cute to eat! Next, we were served the Chef's Special Tuna Ball, chopped tuna tartare marinated in a spicy sauce and stuffed with cream cheese and topped with avocado slices. Love the rich, creamy mouthfeel that this dish exuded along with the spiciness perking up our tastebuds. Who doesn't love a good temaki (hand roll)?

I love eating Japanese food, but what I don’t love about it, is the bill. Japanese cuisine does not come cheap, unless you are willing to settle for substandard quality (supermarket pre-packed sushi). Luckily for me, I received an invite from Qguides.com and Hilton Petaling Jaya to do a food review on Genji. So far, I have only tried Genji’s lunch and dinner buffet, because I have a healthy appetite and love a good selection. After a short briefing by Jek (from Qguides.com) and Cindy (from Hilton PJ), rif and I were ushered to Genji. The entrance is simple, and inside the restaurant, the ambiance is serene, inviting and full of sensory delights. Once seated, we were given the menu and shortly after that, Amos, the F&B Manager came over to inform us of their latest Kobe Beef promotion. The man behind the good food at Genji is Chef Richard Teoh, who boasts 23 years of experience under his belt. Our head waitress was very knowledgeable and helpful when it came to recommending a few special dishes. We kicked off our dinner with some Ginjyo sake (RM85 for 300ml). Ginjyo is not a brand name; it is actually the grade or quality of sake and it means premium sake. I?m no sake connoisseur, but I found the Ginjyo refined and aromatic with a slightly nutty taste. It is best taken slightly chilled, for warming or over-chilling premium sake tends to mask or destroy its delicate flavours. The menu was extensive, and we had a field day choosing a variety of dishes to share. First to arrive was the Sashimi Moriawase Jyo (RM230), an assortment of Toro (tuna belly), Butterfish, Kampachi (yellowtail), Salmon (sake), Amaebi (prawns), Maguro (bluefin tuna), Shellfish (scallops) and Ikura (roe). This was outstanding. Of the selection, my favourite was the toro. Toro comes from the underbelly of the tuna, and its grades are distinguished based on the marbling of the fish. I was as excited as a child who just found a candy machine when I saw three thick rectangular slices on the sashimi platter. I popped one in my mouth and closed my eyes to savour the moment. At first bite, the texture was firm. Then, it became moist and meltingly tender, and the taste of the toro came through ? meaty, buttery rich and ethereal. There was nothing quite like it ? the experience resonated long after the toro had slipped gently down my throat. The yellowtail was delicious, as were the scallops (almost the size of a 50 cent coin) which came in a hollowed lemon bowl and topped with bright orange roe. The pairing of the scallops, roe and lemon zest created a combination of interesting textures and flavours (scallop, fish roe and lemon). I rather enjoyed the prawn sashimi, which didn?t taste raw at all. Instead, these giant prawns were crunchy, sweet (literally) and meaty. For a moment, I thought I was eating scallops, until I felt the tail of the prawn nudging the roof of my mouth. The salmon, tuna and butterfish were all very fresh. Unlike the tuna which had a firm and lean texture, the butterfish was light, creamy and slightly watery. The salmon was supple and melt-in-the-mouth tender. We were halfway through the sashimi platter when the soft shell crab temaki (RM13 per roll) arrived. I would have preferred it to be served after we were done with the sashimi, but all was forgiven when I sank my teeth into the roll. The fine crab was complemented by a dollop of mayonnaise and briny, popping roe. I chuckled between mouthfuls as I watched rif’s eyes roll slightly backward as he polished off his portion of the handroll. Soon, other dishes arrived at our table – each brought with it something new, distracting us from the previous. The agedashi tofu (RM13) consisted of four squares of tofu, which were lightly battered and deep-fried, and served in a soy-ginger sauce with a scattering of dried bonito flakes on top. The tofu texture was firm and custard-like, while the light sauce with chopped scallions added flavour to the otherwise bland bean curd. I didn?t particularly enjoy it as I like my tofu dishes spicy and flavourful. rif ate most of this. We ordered a customary serve of unagi kabayaki (RM50); it had a glistening mahogany-coloured, soy-based veneer. The eel fillets were glaze-grilled, leaving it crisp on the outside, but tender on the inside. The sweet, caramelized glaze accentuated the oily and rich texture of the eel. Another splendid dish was the kaki chilli mayo (RM14 per piece), which was baked fresh oyster in spicy mayo. The big, juicy oysters with creamy sauce were in a class of their own. Instead of overpowering the oysters, the sauce paired very well with the aphrodisiac, which almost spurted when I bit into it. I’m not a big fan of fish, but I do love eating cod, especially when it is done a non-Chinese way. Grilled to succulence, the black cod (RM52) was slightly crisp at the edges. As I cut into the fish, its firm, glossy flesh flaked beautifully. It was sweet and rich (a reminiscent of the sea), perfectly complemented by the subtle sweetness of the teriyaki sauce. We ate everything, including the garnishing.",4.5,999,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Its team of Japanese chefs skilled in the art of traditional methods of food preparation and service deliver a culinary experience matching what might be found in the best restaurants there. Over the years, it has won international acclaim and recognition including awards for best Japanese restaurant from publications such as Malaysia Tatler, Miele Guide, Hospitality Asia Platinum Award as well as Time Out Kuala Lumpur awarding it the “Best Japanese Restaurant” for consecutively 6 years since 2011.",4,328,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Features a sophisticated Hinoki Wood Sushi counter that will surely bring your Sushi Omakase dining experience to the next level. To all Japanese cuisine lovers, you should check out the brand new face Kampachi at Hotel Equatorial Penang. The award winning Japanese restaurant has a team of Tokyo-trained chefs, preparing authentic and exquisite Japanese cuisine with fresh premium ingredients air-flown from Japan that set to entice your taste buds. It is noted Kampachi also one of the very Japanese restaurants in Malaysia which serves the exquisite Ayu Fish. Recently, we managed to try 7-course Omasake at Kampachi at Hotel Equatorial Penang, which means letting the chef decide the menu for you using the seasonal fresh items from Japan. It was totally a delighting experience to enjoy fresh Japanese Yellowtail Sashimi, Kyoho Grapes, Hokkaido Asparagus, and many more. The omasake course starts at RM 218+, depending on the availability of seasonal ingredients. To surprise the diners in Kampachi Equatorial Hotel, the head chef of Kampachi Kuala Lumpur, Alex Lee will make frequent guest appearance here. The unique collaboration between Chef Alex Lee with the local team is set to elevate the signature dishes here to another greater dimension. The appetizer is made up of 3 different small bites and the taste is foreign to our taste buds. The taller glass, featuring Ika Shiokara which has various marine animals in small pieces has a strong and pungent taste. Meanwhile, the smaller glass has Japanese style salad within, balancing the ratio between fibers and protein in the whole dish. Another component in Zensai is Shake Carpaccio, which features smoked salmon along with signature sauce. Next on the line is a simple, elegant yet delicate dish - Kinoko Suimono, or better translated to Japanese mushroom clear soup. The soup is brimming with mushroom essence, so light yet so soothing to the palate. Its temperature is also nicely calibrated that it is best drink once served to warm up the stomach. Kinoko Suimono is a popular summer dish in Japan. No Japanese cuisine will be completed without sashimi. Therefore, the third course of the omasake features 3 different types of sashimi - Maguro (Tuna), Hamachi (Yellow Tail) and Ameabi (Sweet Shrimp) air-flown from Japan. The cuts are fresh, soft and without any slimy texture. Ameabi is significantly different from the conventional shrimps we had - it is sweet with a delicate texture that certainly enjoyable. The Wasabi, when eat in a proper Japanese way along with the soy sauce (in fact Kampachi provides 3 different types of soy sauce) will give it a nice tuning to the overall sashimi. The fourth course on the Omasake menu is Gindara Teriyaki, a grilled sablefish with soft flesh and pleasant buttery fat content. Noted that Gindara is an exquisite dish in Japan and the price do not come cheap. It is grilled with a traditional sauce to give it a nice and light taste.",4.5,84,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Now I've been here a couple of times before, but this was the first time I found out there was actually a really big section located deep inside Food Republic where it is more serene with less noise and customers. Anyway this post will be the first of a series of food posts from Food Republic. The 13,000sq ft food atrium can seat 550 at full capacity and has 15 tenants with an interesting mix of cuisines ranging from Malay, Chinese, Japanese, Middle Eastern, Western, Taiwanese and Malaysian. Our choice this time was the Express Teppanyaki. Going for the Chicken Chop Set, our meal was prepared in front of us by the cook as we watched on. Check out some of the photos I managed to capture of my Chicken Chop Set in the making. Like any other Teppanyaki outlet, the food and meat was prepared in front of the diners. It was the same here, except probably slightly faster, hence the word Express Teppanyaki. Our rather tasty Chicken Chop Set was prepared in less than 10 minutes, which came with vegetables, the mandatory beansprouts, soup, a bowl of rice and of course the chicken chop itself. The chicken as expected came out really tender, and doused with the sweet sourish spicy sauce, it tasted good. Express Teppanyaki presented the dish on this aluminium foils placed on the hot cooking area, ensuring the food never cools down. Usually when I have Teppanyaki at other food outlets, I'm not very fond of the vegetables, but here the way they made the green vegetables got me wanting for more.Overall, I pretty much liked the Chicken Chop Set that evening. Tasty enough, and prepared with enough effort to make it look presentable and nice. I'm sure most of you have been to Food Republic in 1 Utama before, but do try out some of their different stalls available. There will be more food posts from Food Republic coming up, so do look out for it when it does.",4,50,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

So, don’t worry guys, even though it is dark you can still enjoy the dinner (tak payah risau, kot-kot lah ada binatang terbang masuk food kan) and have a pleasant conversation while able to look at each other clearly. They have western foods, burgers, even for vegetarians as well! Food taste? We tried on of their signature dish, Hainanese Chicken Chop The food is delicious, the gravy is tasty. Maybe I don’t really like fried chicken chop but when I eat it with the gravy then the food taste make sense to me. Haaa! If you really like fried type chicken chop, this is recommended for you. Then, we also ordered Chocolate Moist Cake with Ice Cream, too bad, we can’t choose the ice cream but still it has good combination. I like the cake, it fluffy and moist. That’s all that we tasted, because I was full before we went to the restaurant, that’s why we did not ordered more. There are many many more meals for you to try. If you try it, let me know which the best. I would definitely come here again and try other menu. Oh yeah, it is a HALAL restaurant okay. Nanti jangan tanya eh sis halal tak tu?

The price is cheap compared to other places. It is value for money Cafe. But limited sitting capacity as you have to wait during peak hours. This place has great Turkish food. I visited there everyday. Food is a little bit pricy but amazingly delicious. Drinks and juices are also very natural and tasty. You can order your food take away too. Surrounded by the usual fast food outlets, this is where everyone should be going. Good wholesome Turkish food, tasty and good quality. Quick and affordable. Love their lamb pide. Also fresh juices. So if considering a nasty burger or cardiac chicken, do yourself a favour and get some great food at Bahce. When you pass the small restauran, you just pass it, because it looks not really impressive. but after i read some recommendations, we decided to visit this place. very friendly people. easy going food. we ordered humus and iskender kebab. quality is fine, but for sure you can not compare with istanbul. but this is KL and streetfood. Ayran was also good. price value is perfect. next time we will stop there again. What a delightful little find among fast-food giants! Located literally alongside a McDonalds and near a KFC you'll find Bahce. My husband and I went there to have lunch and we're delighted by this ""hawker stall-like"" gem (tables are outside and you place your order at a window and your order will be brought to you.) The proprietor was incredibly friendly and helpful, the meals full of flavor and fresh. We had one of the lamb ""pizzas"" which had a kick and is light and crispy, eaten with salad on top and a squeeze of lime. We also had delicious chicken and lamb dishes. The rice is flavored with something slightly sweet which is perfectly complimented the seasoning in the chicken. Forget the fries, they are flavorless and add nothing to the meal. Fresh juices completed our repast, all for 70 MYR (US$16.). Bahce is located at Ampang Park station so make a point of having lunch there on your way to or from somewhere if it's not close to you. Yum! This hidden little jewel is located outside the entrance to McDonalds! Tables are on the sidewalk and in the alley way at the mall entrance. No worries.

The shop always have customers, so the grill is always on and the meats kept being shaved (which equates to juicy meats). We had a chicken shawarma, and thought the chicken was well seasoned and flavored. The veggies are okay. Prices are reasonably low. Many items are less than MYR10. You may dine in, take out, or in our case, just eat your sandwich at the curb. The meats portion is not as generous as the one that I usually get in the States, but then again the price is only at a fraction that we usually pay at the States. I would definitely come back when in the area. I would definitely also pay more for the extra meats. The best Shawarma in town. I did try both Chicken and Beef shawarma Great food and price is cheap for Reg roll only 6.00 RM. The Shawarma is the best I had out of Damascus. I enjoyed the beef flavor the most.

I'm not sure if it was the manager looking after us but he was very friendly and answered any questions about the menu options. We ordered a combo platter to share - lamb, chicken, beef and it was great! We were just walking by this restaurant & decided to in & it didn’t disappoint. Calm atmosphere, waiters well behaved & the lighting was a bit romantic. The lamb shank was perfectly cooked, the meat came off quite easily & the spices were quite flavourful as well. Tell them to make the Biriyani rice a tad spicy, as Arabian rice may come off as bit sweet for most. We ate here last night and had a superb quality meal in this Moroccan themed restaurant the service was very friendly and relaxed and the variety of choice was reasonable , not a lot of vegetarian options though we would definitely recommend the restaurant but as with most eateries in KL it’s not cheap but nothing is in this town. There's a short stretch of Jalan Bukit Bintang, opposite Lot 10 & Fahrenheit and just up the street from the very bright lights of Pavillion, where Middle Eastern restaurants huddle cheek-by-jowl, competing fiercely with each other. One has an enormous red sign in bright lights, another a dark, smokey look with plenty of shisha pipes at the outdoor tables, inviting the smokers in. They turn me off. I was drawn to this small, unassuming spot, very clean and tidy, but looking a little tired and quiet. Why there? Because I glanced at the menus of all of them and not one served what I expect to be a ""proper"" lamb tagine. I don't know why, but I was feeling like a rich, spicy lamb stew rather than the chicken shawarma I usually get. I was not disappointed! The waiter was friendly and kind, helping a bit with the (very comprehensive) menu. At least four different kinds of hummus! I chose the plainest one (hummus tahinah), and it was wonderful. Very smooth, done the way the Lebanese like it, with a liberal dousing of extra virgin olive oil on top. The bread that came with it was my favourite kind of thick-ish soft pita, just freshly made for me. My main dish was the Lamb & Plum Tagine. This consisted of a very rich spicy (cinnamon, cloves, etc, not chilis) broth, a few prunes swimming in it, a few whole cashews for texture, half a hard boiled egg, and two small lamb shanks with plenty of meat. This dish comes with a choice of bread or rice, and I chose the bread - same as the pita that came with the hummus. Perfect for sopping up the soup. All this came with a stainless steel pot of wonderful Moroccan green (mint) tea. This was ideal. I know the tea the North Africans generally prefer is gunpowder green tea from China, steeped with fresh mint leaves. I think this was dried, but the flavour was wonderful. I spent RM72 for the hummus, tagine and tea. Not a bad deal, given the central location, portion size and quality. If I was forced to find fault, I'd say that the hummus would be improved with the accompaniment of one or two black olives. I found the tagine incredibly rich, and a bit too salty - perhaps toning down the salt would actually enhance the flavour of the lamb. A last recommendation is to try to cook the lamb a little longer, at a slightly lower heat.",3.5,68,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

But we’re on a budget, so we opted for samplers constructed for sharing, including this Bar Harbor Lobster Bake. such as a split lobster tail, shrimp & scallops on a bed of linguine in a savoury broth.Surprisingly, this surfaced scarcely five minutes after we ordered it – a testament to Red Lobster’s expertise as a fast-service, casual-eating outlet. All of the seafood proved as tender as touted, though in terms of flavour, it bordered on blandness. There’s a mass-market, batch-cooked taste to this, making it fall short of the ocean’s briny richness. RM109.90 before taxes.Lobster pizzas are available, embellished with morsels of Maine lobster meat, mozzarella cheese, tomatoes & basil (RM36.90++). A step up from the crab-stick pizzas that delivery chains often offer, though a different dough & prep method might have worked better for the pizza base, which suffered a not-exactly-right texture, somewhere in between bread & biscuit.There’s lobster flesh in this bowl too, but it’s muddled in a morass of cheesy stuffed mushrooms that seem more ‘guilty’ than ‘pleasure.’ Part of a RM45.90 ‘Seaside Sampler’ platter that also comprises ‘Parrot Isle Jumbo Coconut Shrimp’ (Bubba who?) & fried calamari with peppers (the batter’s a little too soft for that one, pictured further below). The menu is wide, so even if you’re not into lobsters, other seafood can be ordered, from parmesan-crusted sea bass (RM36.90) to oven-broiled flounder (RM28.90) & mussels marinara (RM26.90). On a positive note, Red Lobster Malaysia currently has a strong service team, comprising Asians working alongside Americans from Red Lobster’s headquarters; they’re enthusiastic (some with a sparkling sense of humour), patient (with a smile always near their lips) & obliging (even when tackling tricky requests from customers to switch tables at peak periods).",3.5,133,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Since that time they have had a change in chef and management and we’re curious to see how this has influenced the menu.Set on the pedestrian strip of The Hive, the façade of Byblos Lebanese restaurant offers a small al fresco seating area, while indoors is adorned with antique items from Lebanese culture and the back provides a covered area overlooking the greens of the Royal Selangor Golf Club.We’ve come late afternoon so the restaurant is reasonably quiet but we’ve heard that things really liven up around 10:30 pm in the evenings when live Arabic music is played and the weekend’s host belly dancers for additional entertainment. The kitchen doesn’t close until 3:30 am on the weekends!Today, we’re fortunate to have the assistance of Alex (manager), Wasan (marketing) and chef Arzouni to guide us through the menu. Those familiar with Al Amar in Pavilion might recognize Alex and Arzouni. Prospects for a delicious and enjoyable experience are certainly looking good with these two at the helm. All good Lebanese meals begin with mezze and the traditional accompaniment is Arak (1/4 carafe, RM100). I’m not about to argue with tradition and happily accept this cloudy anise-flavoured liquor to open the appetite. Arak is ubiquitous with celebrations and get-togethers with family and friends. Clear in the bottle, a dash of water is added making it go cloudy just before serving.The best way to enjoy mezze is with a bunch of friends ordering a variety of cold and hot plates to share. Hummus with Nuts (RM20) features the classic recipe of mashed chickpeas, tahini paste and lemon juice topped with olive oil. This version, however, is lushed up with the addition of pine and cashew nuts. The paste is smooth and creamy and the generous crown of nuts furnishes a welcome crunch.Another of my favourite mezze dishes, Moutabal (RM15) is made with minced eggplant, tahini paste and lemon juice. A drizzle of olive oil on top balances out the mild acidity of the citrus and the bitterness of the sesame.Alex introduces the Shanklish (RM26) with a warning, ”It’s a love or hate dish. For me, I’m deeply in love. I am a lover.” The reason for the discord is the pungency of the cheese. Sometimes referred to as Lebanese Roquefort, shanklish sports robust flavours and aromas and a sharp finish similar to that of blue cheese. Chef Azourni makes the cheese from scratch and it’s served with a bunch of finely chopped vegetables separated in a bowl. It’s recommended to mix all of the ingredients together adding some olive oil over the top just before adding a spoonful to a piece of bread (also proudly made in-house). If you like blue cheese, chances are you’ll find this delicious.From cold to hot, we move to deep-fried minced fava beans and chickpeas moulded into patties with the Falafel (RM 26, 6 pieces). Served with a tahini sauce and condiments, these are a quality version – not the greasy outers and dry middles of my Australian food court memories but rather a thin crisp coat holding a moist mashed centre.Fattet Eggplant (RM25) is a recent introduction to the Byblos menu. It’s a Levantine dish of crumbled toasted pita covered with fried eggplant cubes, warm tomato and tahini sauces and cool tangy yoghurt. A topping of cashew nuts and hot ghee again take an already delicious bed to decadent heights. Pickles, cherry tomatoes, spring onions and mint leaves make fresh companions. Fattet Yoghurt (RM22) is the basic version of the above and can be mated with any number of toppings. This one must be eaten hot. What seems to have fast become a brunch staple in hip cafes around the world, Shakshouka (RM22), has a rich culinary history across the Middle East with any number of slight variations from region to region. Here, poached eggs (or fried or scrambled according to preference) come with a rich tomato, chilli and onion sauce seasoned with ground cumin. The familiar sides of flatbread, cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, spring onions and mint leaves again supply balance of flavours and textures. I am rather fond of this version. It’s very approachable, not overly spiced as has become the norm in many cafes.",4,51,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Byblos Cafe & Lounge.jpg,,

You will leave this place happy and content every single time.Well, it not a real cruise ship by the way. But the decorations and theme in this restaurant could bring up the feeling like you were on a cruise, save for the sounds of splashing wave and seagulls. The service is fast, and reliable. You may choose to sit in a setting of small huts, on a boat, a wooden junk or just simply their main hall (if you're lucky, as the place tend to be crowded during dinner hours). The food is just nice, although I think it tastes nicer a few years back (or maybe I've tried a lot of restaurants, that my tastebud standard increased, haha). Ordered Chicken Cordon Bleu, my favorite western delicacy and my date chooses their signature spaghetti dish. Mine were good, except for their black pepper sauce which seem a bit sour. The price were cheap, so the huge crowd during dinner time is understandable. Parking is a hassle during that time, but ok after 2200hrs. Nice joint to hangout with friends, date or family. The atmosphere were filled with a live music show by a local singer (don't know if it's the same person every night but he's good) who sang a number of local and international hits along with his acoustic guitar. Don't forget to tip him for his effort, although it is not mandatory.This restaurant serve only western food. The service here is super fast. Food is tasty and cheap price. I have to wait for 5 minute for empty table.This place always full house when I visit.Went to this restaurant because of the look from outside. Once we got inside, sigh...the cleanliness bothered me a lot. Either the customer really uncivilized or the staffs and owner didnt do much to clean up the restaurant. The food was decent. I had lamb chop, nothing much to rave about. My husband had chicken chop which was pretty good, and my sister in law had the macaroni beef ball which was new on the menu, tht I can say pretty good as well. My husband's durian belanda (soursop) blended was the best of all. I cant get enough of it. My apple asam boi and sil watermelon laici were so-so. Overall, i wish they took a good care of the cleanliness of the place and perhaps the environment could give bigger n better appetite to the customer.",3.5,16,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Love this place!I like the food over here, especially the portuguese oven baked talapia.It's really tasty.Don't miss this restaurant if you are near by.i visited Emily's to celebrate my husband's birthday. we ordered Ribeye and Sirloin steaks and 2 soups. the steaks were really tasty. the service was amazing, once the food came out, the staff asked whether our steaks is okay or not. i think its rare to find this kind of service elsewhere. other than that, the staff gave us apple crumble with candle for my husband. it was really cute. i really appreciated it. i definitely will come back again next time. i really satisfied with everything.I came with friends last week & had a great time. My friend ordered ribeye.The steak was good (cooked perfectly). And, the grilled salmon was really good . Enjoyed😍we decided to reserve a table at the garden for a surprise birthday party for a close friend. but the weather was scorching hot that the owner offered us to celebrate it in the VIP lounge instead. the owner and the staff themselves helped with the surprise. their dedication and willingness to make it happen was beyond amazing and it was a success. thank you Emily’s! awesome food too oh my Lord! the steaks were impeccably amazing. cooked perfectly to our liking and all the other dishes were exquisite as well. the price range is quite affordable in my opinion. i’d happily pay more for the 5- star service and assistance thank you again!!I just really love the food.

Fries, meat and sauce were served cold. The Cowboy Ribeye Steak was rubber like as cooked in water - inedible. Speaking to the waiter, he just heated the same dish by microwave.The worst steak I’ve ever eaten! T-bone was stringy, overcooked and tasteless. Far far far away from U.S!!! I totally don’t recommend.First time for us trying this place. We wanted to try out as there were crowd. We waited to be served but unfortunately we end up looking for the waiter to serve us. Once ordered we have to wait for more than half hour for our food. The waiters not friendly that is rather annoying. The food were fairly good. I presume this people just being corky since crowd is there. Even the cashier was rather rude. We definitely not coming back even though food is fairly good. To me service has to be good or rather respect your customer it is also your selling point.We ordered fish and chips, lamb chops, chicken chop and grill chicken but all of it was drowned in brown sauce. Fish and chips in black pepper sauce?? Horrible. Go to Pekan Station, more respectable food there.I ordered Sirloin steak with mashed potatoes. The steak was actual an half in Flank Steak soaked in a bland sauce. Very chewy and more than done, the beans were cold, straight from the can and the mashed potatoes were the size of a golf ball.Affordable, cowboy theme western restaurant in the heart of Kampung Baru, Kuala Lumpur. Service is fast (although their waiter/waitress seem unfriendly by the looks) and plenty of food choices. Parking is a hassle for cars and other 4 wheeler & above but ok for motorcycles. The only downside I could find is there's always individuals who'd come and beg for money (for various reasons) who'd come by from one table to another and street artists (if you could call that to some sing-for-a-ringgit singer with acoustic guitar) who'd stop singing immediately after you put the money in their basket/hat. If you're looking for a nice & affordable food, while didn't mind the 'interruptions' you're welcome!1 of the cheap steakhouses that you can get in KL city. Love the ambience and decos.

I had to queue for long and when it came to payment the staff didn’t even know the price . Everything was messy , disorganized and an utter disappointment. I even got the wrong order when I came back home. I bought burnt cheesecake but I received the peanut butter one. Soooo unacceptable. I hope your management will take action on this wrong order , as well as the failure to serve your customer at Pavilion Bukit Jalil today. I’m sure I was not the only person who was very upset . I bet the person who received my burnt cheesecake expecting her peanut butter cake was also disappointed by this event. While I was queuing the ladies ahead of me (not just one but 3 ladies) were also irritated by the service Huckleberry displayed there. Please take action.Huckleberry is very well-established in Damansara Heights area. Come at any time of the day and chances are high that they are doing brisk business - whether dine-in or even takeaway. People are lining up just to buy their breads or pastries.Apart from that, they are also quite popular among breakfast goers. Come weekends and most likely they'll be full house. Why not? Food is good, coffee is good and service is good.Eggs Benedict RM32.90 - expect full blown version with 2 poached omega eggs, House-made hollandaise with either smoked salmon, turkey ham or Portobello on top of bread. I went for smoked salmon. Served with salad on the side. A favourite breakfast item with the minister.Roasted aubergine Shakshuka RM22.90 - Tunisia. Style omega baked egg in slow cooked roasted aubergine and tomato stew, topped with feta and served with house-baked bread to mop the sauce. My kind of breakfast.. warm and comforting. Buttermilk chicken burger RM28.00 - deep fried buttermilk chicken thigh. Nothing could make the sonny happier than a burger made right.Scrambled egg on brioche - gotta love the touch of colours. Perfectly done with slight runny texture. Pasta topped with a crispy chicken tends to be a very risky dish especially for take outs as the batter of the chicken has the potential to go very wrong resulting in soggy batter and overcooked chicken due to the dried in the delivery box. So how did a cafe renown for their delicious pastries fare? The pasta was aldente, pretty much cooked to perfection and accompanied by a delicious cream sauce. A little stingy on the sauce though. Loved how they sprinkled parmesan and parsley over the top giving it a nice touch. The tomatoes were a little overcooked but still refreshing. The chicken however, was a little dry and tough with the batter a little soggy probably due to condensation and lengthy ride in the delivery box which was a bummer. All in all, it wasn’t all that bad, but has room for improvement especially at that price.",3.5,123,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Disappointed that our food was delivered at different times mine was out for a long time before my husbands.Been so many places and Tony Roma's place never dissappointed to order their beef and lamb ribs. Smoky flavours with hot and spicy sauce is so tempting. Never bored to come again just to have their ribs.

At times you had to wait to be seated. However my outing with friends from overseas at Tony Roma's Pavilion on 2nd October 2019 was extremely disappointing. It answers why the outlet was kind of empty.You would think they would give u good grub for the price you pay. Nyett... Ur wrong. Has the worst tasting tenders, salad was not fulfilling at all. Drinks were poor. The only think that perhaps salvage this experience is great utensils and service.We are a regular customer of Tony Roma's wherever we are. But this is one of the best. The offer was attracted to my family we had the Rib lamb steak which was so tender and juicy and the taste was great.It’s 12am and the restaurant is 20% full on a week day, it does make a difference with the food quality.

Placing your order was simplified by just scanning the QR code on your table. You will find menu n even payment is done while sitting at your place.Then just wait for your food n drinks to be served.Really enjoyed the environment. Must come here again some other day. Wonderful.Strategically located round the corner from Petaling Street, the café has nice vibes, welcoming staff. Burgers are their specialty but I always cave in whenever I see the word “truffle” and this was no exception. Or rather, this was the exception as there was nothing truffled about my order, “Truffled mushroom on toast”. Disappointingly, it turned out to be a plain mushroom omelette with an equally plain bunch of salad and cherry tomatoes. Not even a drizzle or a whiff of truffle oil or dressing or any other condiments for that matter. Set me back 19 ill spent bucks. The other order was their double classic cheeseburger 25 bucks. That was okay but you know how it is for burgers costing a quarter of a hundred bucks.. the usual one would expect. Still, what the café has going for it is the ambience and trained staff. So yes, do give the café a try if you’re in the area.Used to be one of my favorite places to hangout in KL for coffee and food but I can't help but wonder whether something changed with the cook or management. Coffee still delivers it's punch & aroma however the burgers have dropped it's standards. Was quite disappointed with my burger before but that's most cafes nowadays which priorities looks over taste.Try their signature classic beef burger and dark horse chocolate in the mini bathtub.. its always Vintage 1988 & Fusion Accessories Store!Love the atmosphere and the ambience of the cafe.

The quality is just okay, not so great as they represent Chef Zubir. Overall, food stall serves better than this restaurant.At first glance i know this is the perfect place for us to have a light meal or snacking. Cosy and even for a starter, it was so good. Please try this bread flake with beef (cant remember the name). Being a regular customer at this fine dining restaurant, I recently tasted their new sets of menu.. to my delightful surprise, they still keep the same basic element of east meet west concept and with only fresh ingredients used, the flavour just comes out with every bite.. To those regulars, they also keep some of the old menu, so not too worry, the meat dishes are as marvellous as before..! We are coming back in 2 weeks time to have another family dinner there. Me and husband having our breakfasting during Ramadhan few weeks ago. At first, we made a phone call to the restaurant for reservation. However the person who took our reservation make things complicated such as required some deposit payment through account transfer. It was impossible to do as we were on the road during that time.We almost cancelled our reservation but we received call again from the restaurant, maybe manager I'm not sure. Warm apologized from them and we made pre-order for the main course as they served mini buffet as well.The mini buffet was good even limited items. But I don't mind as the main course were very good. We ordered salmon with some lobster sauce I can't remember the exact name and beef steak. Both were superb!I came to this restaurant the day before my wife gave birth to our eldest daughter. The idea was to treat her to some fine dining before her ""pantang"" starts.Like many customers, we got to know Chef Zubir from being the judge for Masterchef Malaysia. So we were hoping to get good quality food from his restaurant.Exotic food menus to choose from, beautiful dish presentation, attentive lead waiter, nice ambience. This was our second visit to Wangsa Grill. Many of the waiters were new but they were as friendly and efficient as the ones who looked after us last time. The food was also superb. Our daughters ordered the chicken burger, the best burgers they have ever tasted. My wife has the steak escalope which was perfectly cooked and complimented with a spicy pasta. I asked for my sirloin to be rare and it was cooked perfectly. If there was anything they could improve was the cut of the sirloin had a little too much gristle on it and the sauce was a little too salty. Overall very good and we would certainly go there again and explore their menu further.",4,21,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

So, we had our tea time at Zipangu.We saw the Japanese restaurant set up and we thought maybe we should try Japanese food instead (planned to go Shang Palace at first). The Manager, Mr Chew at Zipangu were so helpful and he checked for us the availability of Shang Palace but unfortunately they are fully booked.Ok, long story short story, Mr Chew managed to get a table of 4 for us at Zipangu! Seriously, we had a very good time and excellent Japanese food at Zipangu!The food were fresh and very delicious. We were served by Sutan and Chin , very helpful and friendly staff.Outstanding Zipangu Japanese restaurant, part of Shangri-la Kuala Lumpur. Very spacious. Excellent menu. 50% disc off food with Amex Platinum card.Excellent and delicious bento box for lunch - the beef is extraordinarily tender! Made even better by the discount perk for GC members!Our dining experience was during the CMCO. The outlet ensured all Sop’s were strictly adhered. We were a family of 5 though the restaurant wasn’t busy during our visit, weren’t allowed to sit together.The service was great and the food was mouth watering. We have had Japanese food in various restaurants in KL and elsewhere, but Zipangu is something else... you’ll have to experience it to know the difference.The fish was super fresh and it melts in your mouth, the wasabi is off great quality and the soy sauce is equally superior, the moment the fish which has been dipped in the wasabi and soy sauce concoction hits your taste buds, you’ll be able to feel and taste the flow of difference so very distinctively.The ambiance and decor of the place is so very soothing with the water futures and other authentic Japanese futures.",4,250,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

A choice between lasagna, nasi lemak or club sandwich, we decide to taste everything!!! Cooked like at home, nothing industrial, all fresh and homemade ! We enjoyed it well and finished the meal with a nice coffee!Came across the posting on Instagram of their off menu item, Merguez sausage set. The freshly made sausage bun and perfectly seasoned fries complemented the delicious sausage.And you don't have to speak French to order, although the Chef speaks it fluently.Check out Alliance Française website for the latest regular menu.I enjoy going to this place for a nice coffee and delicious meals! Farita really cares about her guests, thank you! Gustafood at Alliance française looks like a real parisian bistro serving french food and malaysian as well. I especially appreciate the famous cheese omelet cooked by Farita with her legendary smile! Sure, it's always a good time.I go regularly to Gustafood to drink coffee and eat chocolate croissants while my kids are reading books in the French library or listen to story telling. The restaurant is cozy and friendly. Farita and the rest of the team always welcome me with a big smile. I recommend both for for breakfast and lunch, especially for those who like French pastries. You can as well order the pastries to take away.We visited Gustafood after hearing about their croissants from a friend. This is a small cosy cafe located inside Alliance Francaise. The croissants are indeed good, but we love the quiche even more - I really think they have the best quiche in town ! Need to call to book as they only bake limited quantity daily. They also serve lunch and dinner - some items on the menu require advanced order but I am always happy with the simple pasta and meat dishes available daily.

Not sweet tho. The coffee is okay. I prefer vcr to be honest. But not bad at all. Very friendly staff make you feel welcome.A very relaxed crowd sit and type, draw and chat.Spaces for solo, duo and group.Unfortunately I missed the kitchen.The chocolate tart is to die for.A great selection of coffees and tea.Tiles. Bricks. Soft light. Soft music. The perfect place to have some me time or some us time.Their coffee is always good, but even more the avocado bagel and spinach quiche. To my disappointment, they have now discontinued the spinach quiche, which used to be their signature dish and fast seller. The cakes and salad bowls are good too.Good service - nice décor inside. Selection of tempting cakes and cookies - keep you eyes closed and don't think of the calories. The coffee is very good - good flavours and the taste is right. Our lattes were not overpowered by loads of milk taste - we could actually enjoy the coffee taste. Much better than pots of other so called coffee joints.The cafe is small by comparison but apparently has a lot of loyal fans, one of whom introduced me to this outlet.I ordered latte which was nice but I don't like the fact that my latte was not as hot. The taste of the coffee was nonetheless good. The dining area is small and I can understand why it can be crowded on weekends.I therefore would reccommend this place for takeaways and if you have the luxury, go on weekdays during office hours.Love the coffee, and the ricotta cheesecake was excellent, also. Seating—yes, a little cramped and claustrophobic, and plank seating not great. Decor is nice, too, w/exposed brick walls. Finally, we found the staff to be very pleasant and welcoming.I stop by here from time to time to get one of their coffee with white chocolate, which is nice but maybe a bit over priced.One thing is sure. Stay always from the cakes. They are old, staled and fridge dry. The cookies and small tartlets are not bad.Good : the long black was complex and love the sourich taste without any trace of bitterness. Can improve : hope staff can be more welcoming Overall: good environment to relax or catch up with friends or be productive.

Coffee Stain! For many years, I have been going to this cafe to get the caffeine fix after grocery shopping at BIG supermarket.I have affinity to the cafe which use wood and I love drinking coffee with the cup on the wooden table. Taking your seat, they will pass the menu which looks like a magazine that lost down their cafe profile, the founders and of course... Their food and drink offering.Cool Cube - using 100% Colombian coffee made into ice cubes and then diluted with warm, fresh and silky milk. Don't you just love sipping the undiluted coffee - yes it was a pain staking process having to brew the coffee and then freeze it into ice cube form but when you pour the warm milk into the glass & watch while both espresso cube and milk combine.. you'd get a nice chilled latte.Coffee based cocktails in the form of Jupiter - orange twist cold-brew iced coffee which was bold & smooth, citrus obsession, a generous splash of milk foam for creamy texture.Tokyo cheesecake - dense and rich, the presence of cream cut down the richness of the cheesecake. One of the better ones.Latte - when barrista is award winning people, expect them to use good quality beans. Like the cold brew and different creative list of coffee mix to try. Carrot walnut cake is moist but not overly exciting.Coffee quality drop compared to previous visits (a year ago). Food not really good but the staff is very friendly and helpful. Hope to see improvement again for my next visit. The environment is just so so only because is kinda dark inside due to the light. Parking is a bit of expensive too.Nothing beats an awesome Sunday breezy day enjoying ice black coffee with licking egg Benedict with a slice of raw salmon and roared bread with salad, yummy tasty delicious. Had a nice cappuccino with a quite nice carrot cake. A friend had their frozen coffee melted with warm milk- interesting idea. Another friend has a pasta which she said was just “ok”. Go for the coffee! Coffee stain is a good place for coffee. They serve food too and we once had a breakfast here and it was nice and healthy choices of menu.

Great little cafe which unfortunately is only open until 4PM. Ordered bagels today by Grab. The kitchen forgot our add-on of avocado. We have yet to sort out the refund.After Kofi by 77, the next cafe that I hit was Kopenhagen Coffee located in the same Vista Kiara Shoppe. I have no idea if there's any relation to the capital of Denmark, or if their coffee style is the same.One just have to walk up a flight of stairs to reach the cafe. The flooring and counter were raw cement with white ceiling and wall to give it industrial yet minimalist feel.As usual, I chose my cup of coffee - iced latte this time - while she went for flat white to go with her slice of cake. One hour and half was gone just like that. Lovely place. Friendly staff n great food n coffee - Danish coffee. The croissants are served warm. The raspberry compote was yummy. We took the all day breakfast with 7 options. The dessert item which looks like macaroon was really good...tried the salted caramel...then bought back a few other flavors for others to try.Everytime I've been here I've been greeted with sour faces. If I dare arrive an hour before closing I have been told to order quickly and been ungraciously ushered to a table. Kofi nearby is a much friendlier and comfy place to go for a drink and bite to eat.Koppenhagen coffee restaurant is tucked away in a shop lot opposite Gardens International School.It has a minimalist decor reflecting the Danish aesthetic. Food is fresh and nutritious. The menu is small and executed well.We chose the all day breakfast option. From a list you can pick what you want to eat and create your own modular breakfast up to 7 items. In these environmentally challenged times it’s nice to see restaurants helping to create less food waste.Service could be a little more attentive but other than that Koppenhagen Coffee has a very cool hip vibe.Beautiful, well arranged space in a historic building serving single origin house roast espressos and hand pours. Bottled cold brew also available. Not a lot of choice when I was there, but what they had was great. Food looks good, especially the all day breakfast menu.nice place. but coffee is average. no need to drive all the way just to get their coffee. a rm5 coffee from room 203 taste the same for 90% less. their cakes, a dime a dozen. nothing special. pricy too. why are these type of places expensive? ure selling coffee and cakes and some cafe food thats not special and every other cafe is doing the same. mind blowing.",4,29,Cafe,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Staff are friendly and place is wonderful. Would only reccomend to serve faster espescially for people who just want a coffee on the go. Apart from that, the most memorable coffee place in KL for me.Situated by the BB walkway this Illy is my favourite cafe in Pavilion. The interior decoration is stylish and airy, large windows bring light and the tables outside offer the experience of sitting on an Italian piazza. My capuccino and eclair were excellent as allways, newspapers were available too.I live in the Banyan Tree apartments directly above the coffee shop and use it sevaeral times a week. Recently my wife and I have been short changed three times by gentleman from Bangladesh who works behind the counter. We no longer have our coffee here but go a little bit further on. I t is a shame as the coffee is excellent but this deliberate dis-ingeniousness is unexceptionable and I have warned all the members at my club.I kinda hoping that the taste will be as good as the new Starbuck Pumpkin Spice Latte but .... its kinda taste like strong herbs (makjun) ... the macarons were good tho’ but RM 6 per piece is quite expensive for 20 cent size of macarons. Conveniently located and opening early which is convenient However coffee was average and staff a little cool. Good quality coffee. Wide selection on the menu. Place is relatively quiet and service is fine although a bit slow.I think this was the best cappuccino that I had in KL. The sandwiches are good, but you can get the same type of sandwiches somewhere else for a better price. If you want to pay a little bit more for the lunch and want to have great coffee then this is the place. The AC is this area is a bit too cold and windy. The service is “ok” and the atmosphere is good.Since we were staying at Bukit Bintang throughout the trip so this Cafe was almost becoming a daily stop for a sip of delicious coffee if we did not have some plans out of KL or my cousin got bored. At the time we arrived they recently launched 2 seasonal iced coffee for summer; orange and almond coffee and espresso coffee with cardamom (coffee greco cardomomo) and I fell in love with the later that I sometimes crave for it and I go to drink alone where the place is really nice to have a peace of mind while watching people walk through the Bukit Bintang-KLCC bridge walk.",4,84,Cafe,Quick Bites,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

In my bid to save the environment, I have brought some munchies to be shown and kept in my wife’s bag. Instead, I was reprimanded by the supposed store manager for trying to sell other foods in store. In order to avoid a scene, we left. We were given a discount but that’s the last time we’ll ever spend money there, discount or no. It’s a family store so I don’t dress up. Let’s not just assume and stereotype.Beautiful everything. The little kiosk style store has a display of decadence. Cupcakes, slab cake pieces and cookies in a variety of flavors are on offer. It is beautifully packaged and the taste is divine.Cupcakes are quite good. Slightly above average compared to other gourmet cupcake places. Unfortunately staff are completely devoid of knowledge of the product. I asked which cupcakes are filled and was told only the one shown on the promotional picture. Even when I pointed out that the provided description of one indicated it was filled I was told it was not. How can staff sell a product they know nothing about. I would have bought more if I had known.I love their vanilla sky, red velvet, lemonade and fun fetti cupcakes. It was moist, dense, buttery and not overly sweet with tangy frosting. When my cravings hits, I will buy 6 pieces of cupcakes and eat it all by myself. Stayed in Kuala Lumpur for business for 6 days near Suria KLCC so I ended up walking by their KLCC branch and bought the carrot cake cupcake. Their desserts are rather sweet but they are very tasty; from what I recall it was either RM7 or RM9 for the cupcake. They also seemed to have a large selection of hot beverages too which would be a good compliment to their cupcakes.Just had to try the cakes because they looked so beautiful. Had a piece of the red velvet cake, sprinkle cookies and vanilla cupcakes. All tasted as good as they looked. Staff were very friendly and wrote on the cake boxes what each piece was.We saw the shop at lot 10 and ordered a red velvet cupcake. Rm7.40 for the cupcake. It was moist with a lovely cream cheese topping. Not overly sweet too . I wanna try the others now.This cake cum coffee shop is located on the first floor of Bangsar Village 1 shopping centre.

Their staffs were busy cleaningnthe ahops and preparing still. There were already several people lining up before me. Waited till 8 something only they let us in with 2 people at a time. I saw all breads and pastries already wrapped in plastic wraps there. Eventually bought their bagel and croissant to try. Croissant is ok with crispy outer layers and soft inside. But bagel seems not freshly baked, like it was prepared yesterday but wrapped in plastic wraps to keep its freshness. Overall they're ok, but if u are looking for real fresh baked bagels or breads in the morning, maybe can consider others bakers who really doing that.We take away our peach strudels and we love every bits of it...simply worth it..The kind of desserts that definitely you will come back in the future..Look crispy desserts? Peach strudel is crispy and top with creamy cream and generous servings of sliced peaches!The cakes here are amazing and so are the other savory pastries. I highly recommend the Macadamia Cheesecake. The assistant manager, Roy, is a gem of a guy and made my dad’s birthday special. Please don’t hesitate to visit if you are ever in the vicinity.The egg tart was excellent - creamy and soft tart. The rest of the food was okay, coffee was good - all in all bit pricey though. Tables are arranged really close to one another - no social distancing if there is crowd.Great cafe in DPC, another branch outside their original place in Bukit Tunku serving almost the same menu.If you have been to the earlier branch and love their pastries,then you will not be disappointed here.Freshly baked pastries that will you asking for more. Quite a nice environment facing the still-maturing tree.Overall, I will recommend this place for those who's looking for a breakfast, brunch or simply a catch up over a cuppa with friends or family.Much anticipating and finally it’s up and running after the relocation to the 1st block of the same location, it’s brighter and bigger with the refreshing open air seats.

They are a tad pricier than normal but everything is made from scratch, so still very worth it.It is mainly a coffee shop which is serving additional dishes as well.Ambiance is good. We went here on birthday for dinner.We were expecting to enjoy good vegetarian food. But there were not much options for dinner. Also portion size was small compare to price we were paying.We are always on the lookout for places in KL where the whole menu is vegan. Discovering this place was like discovering a goldmine! We ordered a char grilled burger, a pesto pasta and lasagne, with a side of sweet potato fries and all sampled everything. Nothing disappointed! The flavours were subtle, and very enjoyable. We had waffles and ice cream, as well as a wedge of orange cake for dessert. Also excellent.The servers were helpful and attentive and the place spotlessly clean. We took with us a sampling of their in-house baked breads and are looking forward to trying them later in the day.If you are looking for quality vegan fare and great service in KL we recommend LN Fortunate Coffee very strongly.",4.5,13,Cafe,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

We ordered four desserts. The molten brownie, 2 waffle sticks and a mini waffle dessert and all were really delicious. I also had a mango tea which was really nice. Prices were reasonable and service was good too. I walk past several times to find it busy, then decide to come the next day. I saw a couple of tables free, so quickly went in and sat down. I just love the chocolate lava cake, it is so delicious.The staff are great and inform you on how long you may be waiting for your dessert, which is fine by me if it takes 15 minutes as there's free wifi.I really liked it and would go again and again. The taste of real chocolate. Specially their drinks is amazing. I really liked it and would go again and again. The taste of real chocolate. Specially their drinks is amazing.This cafe would attract any chocolate lovers from far. It has a nice decor and located at the corner of melawati mall.The hot chocolate with marshmellows and crispy rice with marshmellows are great and so is the latte.The price is reasonable considering that you cam share the dessert with another.My second visit back to molten cafe , it’s just around the corner from Bukit bintang, staff very friendly and excellent service , the menu is amazing had the fruits with waffle and chocolate sauce.One of my family favorites. We always order Fettuccine crepe and Molten Chocolate for the 4 of us which is really enough. The Belgian hot chocolate also very good. Despite a chocolate cafe, the espresso in here is quite nice.Well i hace tried molten chocolate for 4 times already...but the taste never dissapointed me...a great place to have evening snack or for releasing stress i say....the waiter was friendly & the service was fast...If you enjoy a chocolate hot {or 7} this is the place to go! Every item on the food menu contained some form of chocolate and about 50% of the drinks did too. Not a place to go if you’re counting calories But life’s too short to be doing hat anyway!!!This is the place if you like chocolate. This located just out of LOT 10 in the ground floor. There are number of chocolate dishes and desserts to try.",4,33,Cafe,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

The sign was still hanging up but when we sat in the courtyard and I checked we were actually at League of Captains (were we want to go upstairs?) the young lady server informed us it was gone and it’s now called Charlie Boy. Or something. This place had no vibe (staff were blasé) and the coffee and juice was three times the price of the booming Malaysian place next door called Baba can cook...so we just finished our over-priced drinks and went next door. Which was great!Great coffee at good prices. Try the cinnamon mocha (or chocolate?) latte (with soy milk). Lunch was good too. Staff are all very friendly and speak English fluently. Keep up the good work!Stumbled across the League of Captains since it was on our way to the Monorail station next to the Quill mall. Very nice and cozy place. Most friendly service. The espresso is extra strong (as I like it) and the brownie was tasty. It seems they offer small meals, too. Looked great, but I didn’t try. Surely next time! The WiFi worked well, too. Verdict: a recommendation when you are in the area!We went here twice while we were staying at the hotel around the corner. Once just for coffee and the second time for breakfast. Both times I was impressed with the coffee, but the second time was far better because it was accompanied with my chicken sausage. Very good! The cream cheese and salmon bagel was good as well.You lost a star because when I ordered I was informed you didn't have avocado for the dish I ordered, which is not that big of a deal, but when I suggested he just throw an orange on the plate as a replacement he refused. I mean, I was pretty easy going about the no avocado thing...I just wanted something fresh as a replacement. Great place with really good coffee. Good food and friendly helpful staff. Just round the corner from the Sheraton so really handy for breakfast if staying there.Great place. Hot strong tasty coffee. Yummy cappuccino. Really tasty bagel beef burger. Had a really nice lunch. Service was friendly and helpful.Ok, I love coffee and I struggled in kl to find good cafes. However this place is a gem. They even sold me a coffee when they were closed. Highly recommend for any one looking for a great cup of coffee with great service in KL.Young vibe, modern design , pets friendly, nice people and good food. Relaxed! The venue was industrial in style and the coffee surpassed expectations. If Daneil, the Barista, is there he will help you select the most appropriate drink for your taste. I ended up returning several times for the exceptional omelette, ambience and sanctuary the space provides in a very busy city.",4.5,13,Cafe,Quick Bites,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

It is not a busy place and service is fine.Tucked in the back of the courtyard of Pkaza MK, next to salon 76 and on the same row of Subway is this small cafe that I frequent almost weekly. It is the best cafe in the neighbourhood in my opinion, in terms of coffee.Its desserts look better than they tasted as far as my taste’s concerned. Not bad yet not what I could die for.I like the ambiance and the service and the fact that I could enjoy a nice cup of freshly brewed coffee by myself.I usually get a coffee from here when having my haircut done. You can order and they deliver you next door.Love this place! Great little buzz, have never had bad coffee here. They serve one of the best salted caramel cakes. Service is always nice and friendly. Live introducing friends to this place as you can never just go once!As i am not a coffee lover, I always order their mocha and I like it. They do sell cakes but only limited choices. The coffee portion is very small for its price.Great coffee and cookies served by friendly staff. Free wi-fi available so we could catch up with emails and book an Uber.Definitely come here. It's great, but I keep making the mistake of ordering pour over coffee here. It's good, but not worth the time or the money. I say it only for context, but I have ordered pour over around the world hundreds and hundreds of times. The pour over here takes at least 2 to 3 times longer (every time). There is a science to pour over, but if you can't put those steps together in a reasonable amount of time, don't do it. 15 minutes with no one ahead of you for a eight ounce coffee is ridiculous. So, if it's just me who thinks it, no worries, despite this frustration, which is maddening to me (obviously) I will continue to be pleasant and preach the goodness of your establishment.Its small space inside the cafe is just perfect for relax. The taste of its specialty coffee was in a good balance. I really like its simplicity.This place still has awesome coffee and friendly service. If you are in Mont Kiara it is a MUST try if you are serious about coffee. I don't think you will find coffee this good anywhere else in the city, to be honest. The proprietor knows his coffee...you can taste it.",4.5,21,Cafe,Quick Bites,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

The coffee taste does not diluted witj the ice (maybe the ice cube is made from coffee ...) and the cheese cake maybe the best in town!!!Waited 30 minutes for the apple crumble Bingsu, really worth it. Most delicious Bingsu I have ever tried!Have a quick shot of Caffeine Fix, a Caffè Macchiato by Dal.Komm Yes, that'll do me fine after a gruelling morning. Comfy seats to sit back and enjoy the people passing by.This Dal.komm Coffee branch at Suria KLCC has an open concept and is situated along the 3rd floor corridor. The drinks are great as usual but the ventilation is a bit weak and it can get pretty warm during the day due to the natural light entering through the roof. Expect more customers at night when the weather is more cooling. I got my usual Strawberry Cube, it’s a pity the Malaysian branches do not carry the large straws.Must try malt cruffin. So good taste. It's better share with the other and the green tea lovers you should try their varian of green tea. So goooddddd. I really enjoyed my after dinner cafe latte here at dal.komm in KLCC Suria. Others with me tried the Americano amd also have given their thumbs up! The dessert selection looks very tempting indeed. Friendly service, great coffee plus inspirational messages on your coffee cup !! Highly recommended.Wonderful staff, very friendly and cheerful. Got the iced cafe latte while my partner got an iced cappuccino. Both tasted fine imo. Black Pepper Beef pie was nice and crusty with a generous filling of meat.We ordered one of the chocolate series, one of the coffee series and one of their cake. The coffee tasted average but their cake is nice. This place is recommended for chatting or hangout cause it is quiet and less chaos.

Has indoor and outdoor tables.Very enjoyable coffee location, excellent coffee, nice meal options, great staff - bit of an oasis and gem in KL.This cafe has moved from Jln Ritchie to Lorong Nibong, behind Hock Choon supermarket.

Had roasted chicken and omelette. The place is nice, good place to hang out, very cozy. Parking space are limited, you can park at the roadside but be careful as the road is quite narrow. Recommended.Hidden behind an art galery, in the midst of bungalows and townhouses at Persiaran Ritchie, this is a nice place to brew, chat and have some fresh breakfast. Three of us tried latte, beef burger, omelette and fajitas. All turned out satisfactory.I'mma fan of English breakfast, dropped by this place which is recommended by a KL food hunter. Located at Persiaran Ritchie Ampang, it was a hidden gem that is free of bad traffic. Cozy ambiance with lush of greenery surrounding and outdoor garden seating is available.Had the famous House Egg Benedict and it tasted like heaven!

I have fall in live with it.. rich taste of colombian coffee and a choice of cakes. Bring my friends here..and since then, they also love this coffee shop. Nice ambience and located in Mytown Shopping Mall. You have to come and experience it yourself. Great value as they also offer 10% cashback of which when you return you can get certain price cut.Forget those fancy Latte or Cappuccinos, the best way to enjoy a good Columbian brew is simply filtered black coffee. I like a pinch of raw sugar to spike a bit of sweetness in a cup of Classic Tinto.Juan Valdez cafe has a sparse in cluttered seating and some sofas by the side, providing a better open ambience.the real colombian coffee in the heart of the CBD of KL, a bit pricey but hey you get the real thing. best coffee in KL!First time here and the coffee exceeded my expectations! A good place to chill after lunch and their staff are also very efficient!My colleague and I visited Juan Valdez Cafe on his recommendation as he said they serve the best coffee he's ever tasted.We only wanted a light snack for lunch so ordered some chicken Empanadas and I decided to try the Aguapanela (Columbian sweet tea). After some time the waitress reappeared and said there was no chicken, but would we be happy with beef. We said that was fine. She then added there was no Aguapanela and would we prefer coffee so we each had the coffee of our choice.my favourite spot in Ampang is Juan Valdez Cafe, a south american-themed restaurant that serves excellent coffee. always looking for a non aircon diner after hours freezing in the office, this time i ordered Colombian breakfast for lunch. Scrambled egg with diced tomatoes with corn bread (a colombian name i cant recall) topped with cheese slices. It was decent fare, not too filling so as to spoil my afternoon. Coffee was campesino, black coffee with syrup, gula melaka and cinnamon, an innovative take on coffee drinking. I wanted my coffee hot, and sent it back; hot coffee allows me to partake of the ritual of sniffing the aroma and taking in the full bodied coffee smell before sipping it black, and lastly adding milk by the side....wunderbar! das ist gut!Nice restaurant for a coffee and lunch. Very good coffee and some nice original lunch eats. The Colombian style chicken with rice was excellent.When in Intermark, I often go here for meet ups or have a post-meeting coffee. I appreciate having their lunch menu choices. The quiet, dimly lit interiors. Good choices for coffee and food.",3.5,61,Cafe,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Probably one of the best and misunderstood cafes in KL as people feel their coffee is little small. However this isn't Zeus or Starbucks as it puts them to shame in terms of coffee specialization. Food maybe not much to shout but you come to a cafe for coffee.The coffee is of a high standard . The baristas are well mannered and professional . Cakes and pastures are available but selection is limited . They have rooiboos tea , flat white coffee , and WiFi and air con plus fans to keep us cool. Wanted to have granola with fruits and yogurth, and when I got it the yogurt was the size of a table spoon. I kindly asked for more yogurth (because the dish was so damn dry) but I couldn’t see a difference when I got it back. Honestly I paid for a meal where you said certain things would include. If I ask you to give me more of something you should keep your customers happy. Instead I just paid for dry granola and banana.We came after office meeting . Lucky they had some cafe there but never expected to be in that Excellency. Hygiene, atmosphere, decoration, design were wow. Above of that , staff who's taking care of their customers, are an excellent humans, specially, Ang the girl. Cheers guys. Cakes taste good but coffee needs an improvement. too hot cause the taste of the coffee disappear. nice environment & i think outside seats need at least a fan?? Hahaha, but overall its good! My favourite coffee shop, not only because it’s just next door. The main reason is because of the good selection of coffee offerings. Those who are not heavy coffee drinker like me; strongly suggesting RED LATTE... smooth and tea based latte. This is a must try cafe in KL - the guys who run it are true coffee artists - I was blown away by their commitment and energy for coffee. Great place to people watch too!This is a lovely retreat to get away from heat and noise surrounding the la salle school in Sentul ( of course school kids are noisy at the best of times! Good coffee. Well trained barista (esp the slim bespectacled Chinese young man). Pleasant surroundings quiet and relaxing ambience just perfect for a quiet coffee.

In the afternoon, they were offering free cake with a cup of coffee. The coffee price has gone up to RM 15.90. I guess with a free piece of carrot cake, it was a good deal. But to pay that amount for a small sized cup of coffee without the cake was expensive, even though the coffee was reasonable.Had a nice cup of coffee here. The barista did each cup individually for our group of 4, so wasn't the speediest cup of coffee but no complaints about the end product. Only negative comment is that at RM12.90 per cup, it would have been nicer if the cup was larger!Nothing fancy about this place , just another coffee shop, good ambience due to its location. Service is average , hot lemon tea ordered was below average. Other drinks though were ok. Good place to sit and relax.This place serves nice coffee and drinks. Located on the lower ground floor of NuSentral, it is an ideal meeting place. Service here is good.All I was after was a decent coffee for myself, and a refreshing cold drink for my nearest and dearest. This place certainly fitted the bill.My wife's Italian Soda was to her liking, while my coffee could not have been better.The prices are comparable to back home in Melbourne, so that was a good thing. I really cannot think of anything to complain about with our drinks from here.This is the good place to get coffee for the day as well as their hot chocolate also come with bear design. Desserts too.I have been visiting this place for a coffee so quite sometimes. I really felt it cause the hospitality and greetings from their staffs. As a coffee lover, i always seek a place where there's good vibes and good staff who can make my day happy with a smile. Two young staffs (Foreigners) were so energetic to prepare my coffee in promising time. If you're a coffee lover please do not hesitate to pay a visit. The seats aren't super comfortable, but the coffee is really really good. Early morning there's a buy one get one, I had a cappuccino and a flat white and both were superb. Bad thing is in the morning you can also have a lot of sun if you sit outside. Also has free wifi which was pretty fast when I was there.For real, this place is soooo gooood, best coffee in Malaysia !

Plenty of choices! We both LOVED our food.... the staff were friendly and the coffee was delicious ☺ We will be back!Second time back here in a year. It’s my must-stop-by place for breakfast in KL. On first glance it might look like just another hippie cafe that’s sprouting up everywhere but this is a place you do not want to pass judgment on too soon.Awesome breakfast here. Ordered a big breakfast and everything came perfectly done to the detail. Their deserts are also exquisite, nicely plated and just yum!Don’t pass up on the drinks too! They serve good coffee and hot chocolate.The only con? It’s more pricey than your standard Malaysian breakfast. In exchange, it offers you a quiet peaceful escape from the bustle of the city for a bit.They also sell some cookies if you would like to bring a little piece of them back with you. (Coffee cookies tastes highly similar to the famous HK Jenny Cookies). We were lucky to find this cafe as it's quite hidden but worth finding. Brunch options are really good and desserts are amazing. We visited twice whilst in KL.Excellent coffee with good ambience. Service staff was friendly and hospitable. Great selection of dessert.Nice service as well as original and tasty food.

Thumbs up for all of you!I live in the Pavilion apartments and use this coffee shop. Three times in the last two weeks i have been short change by an employee called Ewan or something like that.

Please check your receipt if you are having anything here especially if you are a tourist.Normally I go for a hot Latte, today I tried a cold coffee with a fancy name I can't remember. Interesting presentation, the cold brew coffee atop fresh milk. Enjoyed it whilst I killed some time before my next meeting.The Illy coffee brand is probably one of my favourite coffee beans that can be bought from a grocery store, it’s a shame that the cafe bearing its name couldn’t live up to it. The cafe is a quiet and relaxing place to escape the crowd and recharge with a cuppa. However, the coffee was a let down, but mainly because it could have been so much more with a better barista. It’s a shame really, there’s so much potential here.Nice relaxing cafe whilst awaiting for my next meeting. Open Al Fresno seating on the outside of cafe, albeit it's still inside KLCC mall. I always enjoy their Latte, it's illy.This was a treat to have the fine Illy Caffe inKuala Lumpur. Sometimes you just need the European taste of coffee.

Excellent service by a group of enthusiastic youngster, variety of menu, foods are very well prepared and reasonably priced, great coffee and very relaxing environment. Suitable for friends and family.Love the coffee here. Have been taking roasted coffee beans from this place for the last 2 years and it has been consistently good. Lately, tried out the pasta and was pleasantly surprised. They are good. Will continue to visit Beam.Very artky cafe and let us feel relax but bit dissapoited that my mocha coffee is not 'hot' for me. Revisit BEAM, coffee still great. Love the special brew coffee, done it with passion and knowledgeable. Food are ok from local cuisine to pasta, cakes was nice and varieties. Hope they can maintain the coffee brew standard. Will definitely visit again.Good sandwiches and Salad.. great coffee..they ground and roast their own coffee beans... Very good atmosphere! This is another great cafe to hang out with friends in Kuala Lumpur. Although BEAM maybe a bit far from the downtown area and it's quite difficult to get here, it is worth to drive. Thanks to our beloved Malaysian friends to recommend this cafe and take us here. The cafe serves good coffee, together with breakfast, brunch, some casual lunch menu and desserts.

Refreshing showers!! Easy to find! Helpful when moving on.Had breakfast at this place. Great place with WiFi, to be at when travelling on budget. Moreover, the people at the front desk ( or at the POS, if you like), were warm and friendly. The location is great. I don't prefer baked beans, in this regard one of the employees offered to serve a partial portion of sausages in lieu of baked beans, which, in my opinion is laudable. On my next visit to KL, I would certainly stay at this place. The food is good. Simply a suggestion: If only they could considering frying the eggs on a low flame. Twice I had fried eggs at this joint, both times the egg whites were partially charred.If my memeory serves me correct, they offer a complementary beverage with breakfast. Spend an afternoon here for a lunch and some drinks. Were welcomed by very friendly staff, had an excellent lunch (one of the only places in KL where the portions are not exaggerated and the use of sauce is limited) and had some good drinks. Prices are very affordable and the atmosphere is just very welcoming. Great hostel too. 1. Location is great. 2. Receptionist is not helpful. And racist. Talked to me in flat tone but greet those whites with warmest hospitality. Wanna pay with debit card but line not working, made me walk all the way out to find ATM machine and withdraw money. Because they refused to accept Sing dollar/ US dollar when i ran out of cash. 3. Price is great (RM35/night for dorm; RM65/nght for single room). 4. Room is clean. Though with two cockroaches. Guess is because of the wooden furniture. To me is considered acceptable. 5. Toilet is not clean. Not roomy enough to even turn your body. 6. Bathroom is clean but I can't lock the door. Dangerous for female. But I don't mind. 7. Water pressure not too great. 8. Sleep disturbed with corridor's lighting and voice from outside. But this is soemthing inevitable in backpacker's inn.

Comfort simple local food on offer that will definitely invigorate one´s taste memories of some old dishes.The place looks artistic and it actually felt warm. There is an outdoor seating place. The menu is reasonably priced and with reasonable variety to it. Not really a place for a full and proper meal but just enough for an after dinner snack or dessert.Ordered a normal coffee, chocolate drink and pork lard rice. The rice was plain but tasty enough. The chocolate drink was not too sweet, to me it was perfect even with ice. The coffee wasn't the best that i have tasted, and can be improved. Experience wise, it was quite okay. Good and friendly service, reasonable price and reasonable sized crowd. Not too noisy as well.This food joint was a rare hidden gem within KL with its simple menu and drinks available...A must try was their coffee perfectly done by hand of JON, owner of this joint...You will be amazed with their deco around their premises with lots of posters and toys....Awesome and Amazing. I don’t remember how many times I’ve been here. The cafe is very homely and cozy. The boss is extremely friendly and nice. During my last visit me and my friends afraid that we didn’t bring enough of cash so we asked the boss if we could pay with cards which is not available at the cafe so the boss asked us to order first and can get the money later from the bank after we finish our food.Oh and did I mention about the food tasted great too. I’m vegetarian so vege egg rice is my only go to (they have more option but vege egg rice is too delicious for me to choose others). My bf not a vegetarian he tried other dishes with meat but he said vege egg rice taste the best. If you’re not a coffee drinker like me can give buckwheat tea a try it’s so darn good my bf and friends always order it after the first try.Went there twice, first time was a pleasant experience as they are not too famous yet, love their Japanese snacks and ice cube chocolate/coffee drink. Second time visit was three years after on last week, too crowded on weekends, waited 40 mins on food, food still good but not a place to chill and relax anymore, recommend to go on weekdays night where there's not that much people. Forget about the hipster cafes in town. This is somewhere not so mainstream but with good food and single origin coffee.The owner will take time to recommend and explain types of coffee with customer patiently.

Eventhough the price is a bit pricey, but i never regret because of the taste of the food. I give 5 stars.Really delicious.The important is most cafe opening hours is from 10am but they open very early at 830am. The price is reasonable and the portion is good. The environment is quiet and located nearby shoplot at residential. Hence, it is easy to find parking.It is a small cafe, at 3~4pm is full of people. We had their big breakfast (love love love their bread, but tomato too raw) and the signature pasta bread bowl. Think we're the only ones who ate the bowl. XD Absolutely yummy dipping the bread in the carbonara sauce.The food was really good I loved their pasta and their dessert was so scrumptious and their baby cino always made my day because their design on the babycuno look so cute. Their food is very delicious.Was searching for a ncice cafe for a quiet sunday afternoon when I chanced upon this cafe.Its on 2nd floor of a row of shop house in a nice neighbourhood. They serve all day breakfast, Pasta in bowls, spaghetti, ice cream waffles, different types of toast. Its the first time I had pasta in bread bowl. Interesting. But no soup as explained by staff.Cafe environment is warm and cozy and played nice background music.It is a nice cosy place that serves good food (Pasta was overcooked) but EXCELLENT coffee. The coffee does not have the soury after taste like many cafes but just nice. Signage is a bit small but ok. Located on the first floor with a ok window view. Parking is slight of a challenge but we got lucky :) Very comfy and quiet environment for Sunday morning breakfast, but not when it is crowded. They serve fresh home-made thick toast that hardly can find in town. Good place for bread lover.",4,10,Cafe,Coffee N Tea,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

The place is quite small with a spectacular view of the KLCC park and its surrounding buildings. They don't have a lot on the menu but the food is great. The price is reasonable considering the portion and the location. The service is good too. If you want a good meal in a kind of quiet place with a nice view without breaking the bank, this is the place for you. House special is their nasi lemak, I would say among the best local dish served by such restaurant. Server was courteous and helpful. My usual spot when visiting Kinokuniya. Located inside the bookstore, the entrance is located near front entrance (stationeries and kids sections). I love the place as its just below the bookstore, the view from the cafe is awesome, you can see the lake and beautiful buildings. Menu is suitable for all races, even foreigners. Highly recommended if you are going to Kinokuniya for book searching. Chilling out at my usual Coffee Club outlet, I felt my last joule of energy draining away quickly, I decided to order more than my usual coffee. Their delicious full breakfast seemed too heavy as I was having a dinner appointment afterwards. So, I went for the Egg & Toast which seemed lighter. I had expected one sunny side up egg and a piece of toast so I was impressed by four pieces of toast stacked up aesthetically with two sunny side-up eggs proudly presented below them. Not only its look was mouthwatering, it also tasted platable. I must make a mental record! Patrons of this cafe are mostly staff working in Petronas Towers. It is good for quick lunch/brunch. Menu is quite limited but they have lunch set menus that always change and offers fresh new dishes. Also great for coffee and dessert. I have coffee with salmon quiche. Though the quiche is quite small but with plenty of salmon fillings. If you are in Kinonuniya, its a good place to grab a bite while savouring your new book. High up on the second floor of Kinokuniya book store is my favourite Suria KLCC coffee shop. Classical music is playing, service is quick and friendly, there is no busy hassle as in the food court below. Views open to the park and fountain, skyscrapers forming a background. I have never been served such an elegant capuccino, the face of Botiicelli's Venus was printed on it with liquid coffee. I was interested to see how this was done and the waiter was helpfull enough to show me the small machine with different pictures to choose from, she told me making the choice depending on the customer.",4,11,Cafe,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Scrambled eggs on toast, mushroom taco, and egg and cheese brioche bun were all fantastic. Fresh pressed juices and nice coffee were all delivered with a smile. Best breakfast in a casual setting in KL. Delicious breakfast and incredible coffee at this lovely place. We stumbled across it and were very pleased we did!With the ever increasing pace and pressures of urban modern life, it's a bit of dying privilege now to enjoy some reflective down-time to be in touch with oneself and just let the mind run its thoughts. I've been to this cafe a couple of times now and I've got to say it's my favorite in KL just because it is what it is. The decor is snug and humane (none of the boisterous cheesy life quotes found in cafes..), the background music is chill, meditative almost, and the staff are welcoming and friendly. The coffee is expertly crafted, and gosh the food!! The food is amazing! For a super reasonable price, you're bound to be surprised by the flavors and gorgeous plating. It's very obvious that the chefs here care about the food that rolls out of the kitchen! And it's an open kitchen so you get to see them do their work! Definitely this cafe deserves more attention! Go do yourself a favor and treat yourself to a trip down this safe haven. located at the very different neighborhood where I didn't expected. The café restaurant serving some nice cappuccino and pastry at decent price. worth to drop by for cup of coffee if you staying nearby.  Located in Desa Pandan, I came across the place whilst waiting for my car to be washed at a car wash a few doors down. It's located on the same row at a post office and a sports toto outlet facing a new condominium. On the positive side, I enjoyed the care that went into making my latte and also the tastes of the limited menu. I just wish they wouldn't encourage the cats to roam around the outside tables.

Right amount of caffeine and robust to wake me up and get going. Service was slow even though it wasn't busy. Ordered Wholesome Brunch, food came without tomato ( as stated in menu) , until we notice and informed the server. Then only he mentioned tomato was out of stock, and gave replacement for potatoes. Overall food was tasty, but too much bread ( had panini, muffin, and French toast in one serving plate). The same server who attended us, didn't had a name tag, poor attitude, sloppy, like didn't had the zeal to work.Priced has increased slightly by RM1-2 per dish. My personal favorite here are fancy salmon and egg mayo @ RM25.40. Comes with nice olive focaccia bread served with 4-5 slices of smoked salmon, egg mayo , watercress on top mayo served with fries.Creamy carbonara are nice too @ RM26.40 comes with 2rosette of smoked salmon. Crispy chicken are indeed very crispy boneless served with no dressing salad and fries and orientalists sauce tasted like chilli and tomato sauce mixed@ RM19.00. Served by manager are warm and friendly. Will be back to try their drinks. By the way their chicken puff are meh... way to dry after reheating One of the best cappuccinos I ever had it's quite strong and I paid around $3 USD for a cup but if you are two or will suffice, American breakfast was also good. I went to d outlet inside setapak central, n absolutely love their pastas!!! All are delicious! Even the egg benedict are delicious. Good presentation too.A blooming cafe franchise, TMA provides a comfy space for gathering with friends and family, as well as a right place for business affairs. I visited the one located in T6 Light Grey Mall in Sungai Buloh -- Bright and spacious, located besides the main road.The place is spacious to handle large groups. The food especially the pastas were excellent. Came for a birthday dinner. They accept per-order of birthday cakes. Tried the Palif rice, Americano Breakfast set. All turned out well.

Nice hand pour single origin with many many books around you. (Sorry it's Chinese books) good to have some solo time here. What a pity because this is a great cafe with such a great concept. However, the service and warmth of a restaurant/cafe can make or break it. We walked in to not be greeted by the owner at all. When asked about the history of the cafe, we were abruptly told by her 'I don't speak english - I cannot explain it', when it was quite evident that she speaks conversational english. We ordered coffees and sat down to read our books, while glancing through the books for sale - and were told off by the owner again because the books had to be ""bought"" before you could glance through. Overall, it was a very cold environment and we were very put off. As much as we would love to, we won't be returning here.They have great cheesecakes there. NY and walnut are super tasty, don't waste your money on Nutty though. Herbal tea was good, Coffee is OK.A good place to relax with a cup of freshly brew coffee. Variety of coffee beans. Reasonable price. Mostly coffee brew with syphon.Lots of choices for tea and coffee with a feminist book shop just on the edge of China Town. The coffee was lovely and it was a very peaceful spot with free WiFi to enjoy a break from the fast pace of China Town, lovely.If you are around Petaling Street at the KL center, come and take a break here. The coffee is very nice and the environment is very comfortable. If you are interesting in feminism, you can find some books here and do talk to the owner, you might have some conversation with her.A quiet and cozy environment to enjoy coffee and or just want to be alone, much different from other noisy cafe. Served by the owner herself. I love the smell of coffee when 1st stepped into the shop, just like at home.We went for coffee and cake because of good reviews and was very disappointed. The slice of cake was tiny and the coffee was really week and watery and no atmosphere . Won't be going back. It has a nice vibe and staff. The handcrafted gifts section is really cool.

Even though it's a little bit pricy but it was worth to pay for. Their parfait never failed to impress me. Every layer have their own taste and goes along well with each layer when eat together. It was not that sweet compare to another parfait and that's what made it goes well with my liking (personal opinion). Their staffs also great and helpful. This is a spectacular restraunt. Their food is so tasty that it makes my mouth water like a drooling dog. Their varieties of green teas will take you several visits or more to that restraunt. Their matcha ice-cream is so delicous. The ice-cream has lot's more of actual matcha powder. The amount is so big that it could satisfy a family of three. The cone has the quality of indulgence. There is one terrible problem. The colour and lighting of the restraunt. The colour and lighting is not so appetizing which is why me and my family had to sit outside to look out at the view, but other then that, this restraunt is flawless. Had high hopes for the curry udon here, since nana's originated from Japan. However, I was extremely disappointed when it arrived as the curry was rather diluted, not at all like the ones in Japan. The karagae curry rice however was awesome! Our stop for green tea ice cream. Service always good and they serve us with glasses of water as well. Huge helping of delicious soft serve green tea ice cream in a cone. Had the green tea soft serve; it was delicate and not too sweet. Also tried the japanese pancake with a thick slab of salted butter and red beans, it was better than expected. The pancake's texture was light and not overpowering, the sweetness of red beans juxtaposed by the salted butter - definitely worth a try. If only the personnel at the outlet in MV can be more helpful and look less sour, it would make for a better experience. Great ice cream, really friendly service, clean, super fast WiFi, lovely place to relax and there's no need to rush when it closes, so you can simply hang around for as long as you like.

Tips: Only come here when you are not rushing.my friends and i decided to have dinner at this place recently as one of us heard a lot of positive feedbacks about their famous porridge. the place itself is okay, nothing bad about it. but that’s not what i’m here for. let’s talk about the pricing and the food. their meals were not impressive at all. i ordered the regular chicken chop which was about rm31. the presentation of the food was disappointing. the taste? definitely wasted my 31 bucks. i could get better chicken chop at a much cheaper price. and the porridge. their ever so famous porridge. it wasn’t like what we expected. it was simply bland and to make it worse, it cost us rm31. truth be told, i don’t mind if it’s expensive but at least make it worth experiencing. overall? i would rate this place a 2/5. please try to improve. thank you.We had a class reunion here. The food was good and they staff were attentive but left us time and space to chat Nd catch-up.Ambiance - Recommended to go at night. Having your dinner by the pool is really cozy and the sound of the water, really sooth the night away.Food - Offers a mix of local and Thai dishes.

Suggest to take a stroll to the Golden Triangle area and enjoy the nightlife.The food here is excellent with a mix of local and Thai dishes. Well spiced and good size portions. Always enjoyable to sit by the pool or pond with spicy food and a cold beer - in the centre of KL you can feel you are at a lovely beach side resort. If you are a group go for their set dinner menu -varied and tasty. Will be coming back again and again.Quite pricey but they make up for it with generous serving. Service standards weren't that bad but there's definitely room for improvement. Environment is casual with lots of empty table on a weekday around 6pm.Nice place to get a fresh gateway from the crowed around in Kuala Lumpur downtown. You have decent local food for cheap deals including drinks. The view is greenery and behind some towers.A must eat food here is the teo chew porridge.

So we just walked next door for a quick chat. Had hot brew Ethiopian coffee bean @ RM 11, cold brew pu-er tea @ RM 12 and green tea with white chocolate @ RM 16. To be honest the highlight is the pastry. The dough is flaky and buttery and blends well with the slight bitter green tea and it’s very fragrant and premium quality. Thumbs up. The hot brew Ethiopian taste weak and watery for my friend and he order another cold brew and it tasted better. While my cold brew pu er are ok… Cold tea . Not something I will reorder. My cafe adventure brought me to the busy Jalan Klang Lama (or Old Klang Road.. OKR) this time. Going back to this road brought back a lot of sweet (and not-so-sweet) memories - I remember vividly that when I first came to study in KL, I lived in Puchong with my 2 best buddies and we would always use OKR to get into Puchong. Hey, there wasn't LDP, Kesas, or any highway back then! Even to get to our college, we had to use the two-way traffic along the main road of Puchong. Those who lived in Puchong long enough will know.So back to OKR - how it has changed over the years! The development along this stretch of road that used to be the main gateway to Klang changed the look of this area. High rise buildings now dominated the skyline.Little People cafe is located in a fairly new serviced residences which also house another Japanese restaurant. Entering the cafe made me felt at home right away, with the bright, quiet and calming atmosphere. Looking at their coffee bean selections proved that they mean business.In the end I settled for their pour over Gesha Village coffee from Ethiopia, one of the prized beans in the world of coffee. It was rich, and deeply sweet for me. The latte that she ordered was of good quality as well which made our afternoon caffeine fix a good one.I like the fact that they use predominantly wood for the interior - flooring, furniture's and they even have a solid table top for a bigger group. The next time I'm in this area and craving for coffee, I'll drop by again.To be honest homemade pasta are good, but not any of the rice dish. The rice dish has no taste in it except relying its flavour solely with pesto oil. With a small and little amount of chicken and egg to top of the rice, really not worthy for the priced paid.Pasta are cooked al Dante but sauce are slightly on the salty side, even I can eat saltiness myself. Portion like other patrons said are small, yes indeed small. Like 120grams of pasta given. Just 5-6spoonful of pasta.Order from the counter and food will served it to you.

It's decor is trendy, the lighting bright and inviting. The only problem is the food doesn't live up to its ambience. It's not terrible, just not great and the some items are overpriced. I would go there for a gathering just to enjoy the ambience and to take photos but not for a meal or drink.Atmosphere is well done, cosy and chill. Food was well presented and good. Staff were not quite friendly, can be improved much more.I've been here twice, the portions are reasonable and ia quite cheap for a western oriented restaurant. Not a wow experience but if you have to be in the area for work or a meeting you can stop by.Been here at least one month twice. For some reason every time I'm there, I'm sure order the fried button mushrooms and the fish n chips.The food seems to be very consistent in terms of taste and portioning over the occasions that I've been there.My wife ordered a chicken sandwich. The bread was nice and the chicken wasn't dry at all. It was still juicy. Although we had to wait a little long for it. Maybe they were a bit busy due to the breakfast crowd.I love the fresh juices there and I always order carrot + apple mix juice. I can tell the juice is 100% pure and no added sugar or water (like some other restaurants). However, they seem to fill the glass with full of ice even when I prompt them to put ""less ice"". As a result, I find the quantity of the juice is only around 50% of the glass.The drink was RM13.90 if I'm not mistaken. So I would have expected a little bit more out of it.Good service, try the prawn bruchetta, good seafood pasta, loads to choose from, unimpressed with the fish & chips though. Loved the bread pudding, panna cotta's coulis a tad too sour for my liking. Great night out!Good food here. Halal. I've had the caesar salad, chicken quesadillas, cheese burger, soup and bruschetta. All pretty good.My only complaint has been that the burger was so good but there was cold butter smeared on the bun, together with fridge temperature onion relish. Spoiled the nice hot burger.The selection on the menu is good. The service was average, food was good. Pricing was reasonable, but a bit on the upper side, given the location.

It's lazy and bad for the environment. Coffee was nice. Wifi didn't work. Good location near monorail at Sentral. I frequent the place whenever I am about to board the Monorail station at Kl Sentral. The coffee is good and the location is good. This is an Indian coffee chain selling specialty coffee and tea as well as desserts. We tried the marsala tea and liked it. Location is good and service fast. A good meeting spot. The cafe is one of the leading cafe in India. I felt so surprised to see it here. The cafe is located near the monorail ticket counter, compared to other cafe/ restaurant next to it, it's not so crowded, so it's very suitable for meeting and quiet moment. For the food, I think it's specialty is those with spices, and the coffee is a bit sweet, so you need to talk to them if you want less sugar. And another drinks you must try is masala tea! It is typical coffee shop and good. It was looks good all cakes and I would try it next time. My coffee was good. i had a chocolate croissants, where it is just a plain croissants with chocolate sauce... I had a cappuccino with super hot steamed milk, and also bad tasting espresso base.",4,11,Cafe,Coffee N Tea,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

It was nothing fancy but then the taste was nothing much either. The picture shows my chicken chop. Perhaps the coffee and cakes are better but food is nothing to shout about.We only come here for cakes selection. But service is so so. If you dont have time to book for a birthday cake, most likely you can find a decent readymade cake here. prices are reasonable!Nice banana French toast & sandwiches. The only flaw is that the table & chair is not that comfortable, especially those 2 small round tables & chairs near entrance.So I found myself looking for a birthday cake for my sister on the 2nd of April 2017. Since Solaris is just around the corner from where I live, I decided to pay this quaint little cafe a visit. I must say, they have some impressive fancy cakes there including the all new raved about unicorn cake.Anyhow, my sister specifically wanted a green tea cake and we got her exactly that....It was one of the best cakes we have ever had!Was scrolling through social media and came across their Valentine's 2 person cake. As it was for my Husband I asked them to customise it to be a little more 'masculine' than the original in the photos which they were fine about. From start to finish the service I received was wonderful and the cake was delivered today. It was a real hit! It looks amazing and tastes super yummy! Thank you Little Collins!I have not dined in here, but have used their online cake delivery service a couple of times. They have ready made cakes, but also do custom orders. They are extremely creative and it makes the mind boggle wondering, ""how on earth did they do that."" Highly recommend them.Lovely red velvet cake and coffee. Nice quiet street in Solaris to have an evening tea or coffee outside the cafe with friends.This cafe has a nice selection of delicious cakes and pastries. Custom made cakes can be ordered for birthdays and special occasions. They also have a breakfast and lunch menu.",4,13,Cafe,Coffee N Tea,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Been there twice so far. Cakes were delicious. Drinks were ok. The last time I was there, their cake display fridge was not working. So my friend and I assumed that they didn’t have any cakes on that day. I decided to ask and they said the cakes were in their chiller. I think they should have put up a sign so customers would know as people come by for their cakes. And the guy wasn’t even sure what cakes they had in the chiller! Ambience was ok. However their staff, especially the guy at the cashier, was so not friendly! Not even a smile! He wasn’t friendly the first time I was there as well. (Wish I had took note of his name and complained to the owner). 5 stars ! Good place for chit-chat-ing ! Love the deco . Desserts were awsome ! Been there few times with my friends. This cafe have been here for few years and refurbish decorated lately. New menu are available; hand written on their wall. Want something different and you might want to try hazelnut~coke, or be it a bit adventurous and go for mango~coke. Breakfast is available too. You can get your coffee fix there. Variety of dishes available as well. If you feel like having desserts, their partner shop which is located inside the cafe itself; Souka Bake Shop, have variety of cakes. This place often host talks and sells a couple of Islamic reading material. You can check out their website, facebook, or visit them to have that hipster coffee joint experience. I don't event know where to start as almost all the foods I tried here are delicious! The aglio olio, pulled lamb shawarma, rack of lamb, even the chip are unlike any other. Loved the iced chocolate as it is very thick and comes with ice cream. Desserts by Souka is the perfect ending to our meals too.",4,15,Cafe,Coffee N Tea,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Hidden cafe located in Cheras area in Old apartment. I was expecting a cafe with cozy feel and aroma coffee, however, food smell too strong. Quiet and hidden cafe in Cheras neighborhood. Good place for coffee and tea to chill and relax. They also serve Gin and coffe cocktail. Operated by a young enthusiastic couple, catering to a mostly young crowd looking for a cozy neighborhood deli serving fusion light meals, snacks, pastries and coffees. Reasonable prices and consistent quality. Most important, all local helpers and open kitchen, so you don't have to worry about cleanliness of food preparation. A distance to travel to KL but the foods were very delicious and unique. This cafe rather congested and crowded with customers.

I ordered a beef wrap with my regular coffee. At the cash register the fellow took my fistful of Ringgit coins and gave me back a few. We then went to my small paper money to settle the bill. When I received my food, I was approached by Mr. Zaldi Obet, the owner of the restaurant who gave me a warm and hearty welcome. We then tried to settle only a few world problems before I tackled my coffee and beef. My food and greetings were the best and without a flaw.  This is an excellent place for a quick drink n bite. It is very convenient for the staff of RHB Bank n RHB Merchant Bank. The service is very fast and the food is not bad. They have a smoking and non smoking area in a cozy environment. Always love the way Gloria Jean's brews its coffee. Refreshes you for the day's ordeal. I went to the one in Menara Worldwide Tower, KL, while waiting for my Taiwan VISA. It was a relaxing time, with great service, super friendly team and delicious hot chocolate! I wish they had more vegetarian food, but everything else was good. Wifi is free and great. Music was also a surprise: indie contemporary good bands in the perfect volume. Well, at first I thought what different would it be from any other Gloria Jean in India, but the service did show me the difference. The taste was indeed great but the ambience and the positivity in this place with people walking in and fresh lot being served did make me take note of this outlet as a better one of the lot.

Here's another Starbucks coffee hanging out place. Expect Starbucks standard coffee, in a mall environ. Enough to seat in to will your time away.

We were here for an early breakfast, and the night before it rained, so it was cooling. Nice to chillex The restaurants at that area are always packed. So after dinner, this is a better place for catching up. Clean, quiet and good coffee is the best.

Price is on the high side - higher than you'd get in regular cafe - but experience like this once in a while is OK for me. When I finally looked at my watch, I'd already spent close to 2 hours hanging around.Wow - it’s such a beautiful cafe. The design is perfect, with gorgeous furniture and lots of space, and a cute outdoor seating area. The coffee is wonderful and superb service too. I visited between 9:30am-11am and it wasn’t busy so it feels like a great hidden gem. I’ll definitely be back!Just the place to go for that satisfying quick bite. Their coffees are good.

Limited time only, buy one big size and one small side at RM16.00 only. Regiustea is similar to Starbucks but focus on variety of Tea selection. Drinks is good and can choose level of sweetness according to your preferences, the cream cheese on top makes the drinks smooth and fresh. You wont feel heavy like some other brands. Price is reasonable and seating and environment are clean and nice. Staff performance is energetic. The drink was good. Can choose options of no sugar, less sugar or normal sugar. Or no ice, less ice or normal ice. The best thing is that the person who take the order give good advice on the best price to choose. Which options is good rather than giving you the expensive option she pick out the cheaper options but still same value.

I like their way for preparation for the wonderful menu. It has lot of variety. Absolutely perplexed how they got an average 4 rating. If I could give 0 stars I would. It’s been awhile since I came across such a bad cafe. First off, there was a minimum spend of RM8 PER PERSON (NOT RM8 AVERAGE PER PAX). Which meant everyone has to order something. First time coming across a cafe in KL with this condition. I had patronised a flower themed cafe in Seoul which was beautifully DECORATED and packed with customers which made sense to impose a minimum order on each customer because they normally stayed for more than an hour to take pics with the flower decor and props provided (flower crowns). So I didn’t understand Await Café’s need to impose a min order. Decor was nothing special, barely had any. We went for drinks after a heavy lunch and some of us shared drinks. There were 8 of us so we ordered 5 drinks. Drinks and cakes were mostly around RM14 (overpriced for that bad quality). The time taken for EACH drink and cake to arrive was too damn long too. Dad joked that the name of the cafe made sense cause it’s named Await cafe. Dad puns. Hot chocolate was the worst. It was almost as if only 20% of the drink had chocolate in it. Paid RM14 for that. Sad to say I made better hot chocolate than them. Too stingy on chocolate powder. The drink art failed horribly too. I rather not have any art on mine if I knew it was that ugly. Brownies were tiny and crumbly. Tiramisu cake was too flat in size. Cake portion were too little for the price charged. And I know how to bake both cakes, so I knew the cost put into the cake. TLDR, points for improvement for the mgmt: minimum spend requirement, Horrible hot chocolate and art, long waiting time, cake portion too small. Today I stumbled upon this gem while on my way to meet a client. Since I had an hour to spare, I went in to have a cuppa. They make their cuppa by hand and I chose an Ethiopian Gesha bean, they brew it using the dripper. I also ordered a slice of Pandan Gula Melaka cheesecake and Tiramisu. The both complimented one another. The coffee was served black and it was very fruity. I was told when the coffee is drank when hot and cooled give different feel and taste. Such an experience. The staffs are so friendly and the cafe ambience is very relaxing. This cafe also serves simple rice and sandwiches. I highly recommend this place if you want to spend a quiet afternoon. This is a small cafe located on the first floor in a shoplot. Staff there are friendly and polite. Young crowd and mostly a friendly atmosphere. Slow mandarin music in the background. Nice combination of seats, wooden tables and seats and also cushion sofas. Good selection of coffee and cakes. We were taken to this coffee shop on the recommendation of family. Bit hard to find as it is upstairs and has only a small sign on the outside of a block of shops and business premises. But well worth the effort. It is just a comfortable space with lounges, chairs and tables. A converted balcony creates a slightly private space. Books are available to read (mainly in Chinese) and a few books an nicknacks for sale. When we were there on both occasions students were were working together. Made for a very relaxed atmosphere. Their coffee style was different. No expresso machine as it was all brewed in different ways - drip, filter, vacuum. Their menu guided you through the process of choice and the coffee beans available. There were a small selection of light foodstuffs available. Staff were very friendly and helpful.",4,14,Cafe,Coffee N Tea,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

The price is pretty standard in KL. It's close to 8 Ounce coffee. However, this is the only place in Klang Valley that serves specialty coffee like Vienna coffee. Love the whipped cream on top! It's a great place to chill and get comfort food after a rough week. The chocolate cake was amazing! Staffs are more versatile in Malay than English I notice. However, it's not a deterrent for them to offer a warm welcome.Service was amazing!!!! The staff who served me was so amazingly friendly, full of good vibes and very helpful! A simple smile and a warm welcome and small gesture like pouring water for me made me the most satisfied customer ever!! The carrot cake I ordered was not delicious at all haha but I still love this place. My first visit to this restaurant. We went for breakfast and I ordered poached eggs (come with free toasts) along with hot latte. The poached eggs were hard, including the egg yolks, while the latte was below average (my aunt and her friend ordered iced mocha and hot cappuccino, which are also below average). In terms of pricing, it is average for the latte, and the 2 poached eggs with free toasts (2 slices) cost me RM12. The breakfast set (eggs with toasts + veggie and some other things started from RM18 and above). My aunt ordered a breakfast set with scrambled egg. I would say their scramble egg was good. Food aside, the restaurant has a nice ambiance with an open concept. Not bad if you wanna kill some times or meet up with friends. Most coffee is Malaysia has been quite harsh. My partner says “like tar’ unless it’s the instant coffee that is everywhere. Jamaica Blue’s coffee is completely different. It was smooth and really great tasting. We both had ice coffees (without sugar and it’s been the only time I’ve opted to go without sugar). They were terrific. The oatmeal cookie was fine but the banana chocolate muffin was superb. Highly recommend this place. If you find a cozy place to chill with your friends, maybe you can try this restaurant. They provide variety of coffee and other drinks too. Simple food and not too heavy. The restaurant is located at 1st Floor at a corner area which becomes one of the favorite place in the mall for people to chill out with friends or even families.

Lesson learned never take a risk ordering in this store without asking first the staff or person in charge about the details of what you re ordering because he never bother to ask you or inform you also if you like it or not..instead he is really love to use the world illustration only.

The owner roast their own beans wich he selected in Indonesia. Coming from a rediculously hipster and coffee crazy community in australia, Mollydookers was the ONLY respite from the drought of decent coffee in south east Asia. They're care and passion for the craft is evident in everythng they do, from wholesome snacks to amazing coffee - i'll go out of my way whenever i'm in KL to grab a coffee from the Q wing of the airport. Also, the amazing message wall is an source of laughs and inspiration. I've been able to share a conversation across multiple trips via the post-it notes on the board - something quite special and unique. A typical airport cafe that looks good and charges airport prices but fails to deliver. The coffees were okay despite their claims. We asked for extra hot with one and it was Luke warm like the others. The food looked good but didn't try any so can't comment. The service was so-so. I hope this was a aberration! I stopped by for an early lunch on my own the other day. Sat outside on the bench in the courtyard, which was nice and quiet. Agree with previous review that chair was not really comfortable, but it was ok. Coffee was excellent, I had an iced latte, and found it strong, and really tasty. I also had the tuna sandwich, which was first class. Really fresh bread, lovely tuna mix and a great accompanying salad made for a healthy and satisfying lunch. Menu looked interesting if not a little restricted. But for a coffee and basic lunch, this is a good place to try. Tip: Use underground carpark close-by. Parking on street is a nightmare here, but nobody uses the UG carpark it seems!",4,11,Cafe,Coffee N Tea,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

They have pretty substantial desserts. I say substantial because they are good, delicious helpings. It's a plus that the coffee is good and they have unique concoctions with chocolate and coffee, my two favourite things! Very refreshing ambience. Wonderful hang out or meet up place. They serve beautiful and tasty dessert. Love the place and food. Parking could be a challenge though but it is worth it! Churros was my favourite! Tasted like Melbourne's San Churro. Thry offer a choice of dips and we took dark choc with cinnamon sugar. Drinks were good as well in particular the signature ice tea. If you love dessert - good & delicious dessert, you will LOVE this dessert cafe in Bangsar Baru! With a wide spread of choices to your fancy: Churros, Banana Fudge & Toasted Marshmallows Waffle served w Nutella ice cream, Crema Catalana, Boston Shortcake, Japanese Ice Tart, etc. I especially love the EatMe Iced Tea & my daughter absolutely loves the Nutella Chill Pill. I must credit the churros here... One of the best one... The desserts are unique and all the items on the menu (not too many) is worth the try. The coffee is good and the iced lavender tea... Located just next to KGB Burgers, this prettily decorated small dessert parlour specialises in desserts from East and West. Passion fruit and chempedak tarts as well as durian cake brings fresh ideas and flavours to desserts. The waffles tinged with chempedak and the durian ice-cream is worth a try. We found the churrios too sweet and dense. Their iced lavender tea and berry mint lemon is really thirst quenching. A nice place for desserts. The dessert was fine. I'm a fan of churros, but this one doesn't reach till my expectations. I think that the durian cake is worth a try, if, you're a fan of durian dessert. Excellent choices of desserts so many to choose from,the durian dessert was so durian,so fantastic.also tried the posh version of a banan split.very good.",4,8,Cafe,Coffee N Tea,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Quite a nice cafe. Food and cafe is nice too. Recommended venue for gathering and relax. If one wants to have a private place not recommend to go on weekends. Nice ambience. Average fusion food and beverage at reasonable price. You can request for customized art for the latte you ordered. Nice and cozy space, great to sip coffee while enjoy art. Quiet and relaxing, great for couples and students. Food tasty and healthy, great portion. Coffee art is a bonus. Cozy environment. Friendly staff. Fusion food (large portion) and average coffee at reasonable price. Splendidly, awesome and aromatic coffee taste our bites.

But very simple food, korean pizza, bibimbap, ramen. selection of coffee and teas but expensive. It is conveniently located in an apartment complex and infront of a kindy! good for moms waiting for their kids! I've been coming here for nearly 3 years. They have lovely coffees and cakes and the savory food is amazing. Ultimate faves are the pizzas, avocado smoothie and bimbibap. The pizzas are thin crust and the Base is always crunchy. Combination pizza with the vegetables. The coffee is great and my kids love the pizza - thin crust and HOT. The best are combination pizza (veggie) and beef pepperoni. Juices are good - bit on the pricey side but good - kiwi is the fab! Outstanding Korean food (as it's a Korean cafe!) The bibimbap is just the best. So addictive!!! I know have to ask for half rice as if I keep eating the way I do, I'll be the size of a house. This cafe serves the neighbourhood and has a wide selection of interesting menu from sweet potato pizzas and pasta in a bread bowl to Korean bibimbap. They also serve an extensive selection of beverages from coffees and teas to smoothies. Owned by Koreans, this cafe is busy during weekday lunch breaks. The Café More serves one of the best coffees in KL. Their juices are addictive. The kids love their pizzas. The Bibimbap is delicious (If you are not Korean, you might need to eat Bibimbap a couple of times before you can´t live without it). The staff is super friendly and very polite. Simple furnishings, but very pleasant and relaxing atmosphere. I went to their branch in Gateway Kiaramas. had their coffee and also bagel. My friend had the ramen. bibimbap is also good. a bit pricey but quiet. The one I visited has a children section, so the kids can play while the parents chat. This little cafe is sandwiched between 2 of Mont Kiara's most luxurious condominiums. You would not be far off for thinking that this cafe serves predominantly the neighbouring residence. However, I do feel that, should you want a little privacy, you could make a trip to this place. It's a good place to get some quiet ""me time"". And the latte is pretty decent to boot. Consider this as a neighbourhood cafe for Mont'Kiara 10 and Mont'Kiara 11 condominiums. It's a great place to get some quick meals whether it's breakfast, lunch or dinner. Conveniently located at the small commercial centre at the cul de sac of Jalan Kiara 1, Cafe More now has more space - having taken over the upper floors restaurant/cafe area as well.My kids always love the Margarita Pizza here. I recently discovered their version of aglio olio pasta with pine nuts. Owned by Koreans - it's a safe choice also to find some comfort food from Korea like bibimbap or korean version of sushi.",4,9,Cafe,Coffee N Tea,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Varieties of food, hot and cold drinks with affordable price. The menu should be big and clear. The first cafe opened not long ago at Jakel Mall in Capsquare. From looking at how full it gets at lunchtime, once can only guess the food and atmosphere is good. It is the first of its kind in this new Mall. Soon to be followed by many more eateries and cafes when Lulu Supermarket opens later on this year in Capsquare. It's going to be a fabulous place. This little enclave serves various types of coffees and bakery as well as so local favorites like Penang Laksa and fried beehoon. Although there is a Facebook website, I don't think it is opened by them since I can't seem to find a phone number online. But the place is loved by many locals who work and shop there. It's a pity they do not offer decaffeinated coffees. So hard to get here in KL. If you sell coffee you should sell not only caffeinated but also decaffeinated. I love coffee but late in the day I can't take the caffeine....what a pity.

Ask for the special coffee art, they can make amazing pictures in your coffee for free. Have the coffee and cake. Complements each other perfectly. Would have rated as a 5, but last time I had to wait a little as they were so busy. I had a coffee Bombardiere which blew my senses away with shire delight. As for the naughty special! Naughty but nice. Go and have a good time in a great place. I have been to this establishment many times since I first discovered it in Dec 2017. Although the partners are not full time there, but service and quality of food have always been consistently good. Have tried many of the items on the menu and so far, it has been good. My personal favourite is their lemon thyme chicken although have taken his twice. Even though the crowd was full for Valentine's Day lunch, there was no drop in the standard of their wild mushroom soup, another favourite of mine. Took their pan fried sea bass and it was fresh and superb. My wife tried their pork chop and was good. The skin was not elastic but instead firm and crispy, something we have never experienced even at other pricier establishments. Perhaps could add more variety of desserts selection. Cafe serve free flow of cold water. They also serve western food. Suitable for brunch & dinner. Btw, love the interior. its a duplex cafe. Preferably ground level as they have single sofa for relax seating. Vergine Coffee located in Desa Aman Puri (across Aman Puri Shell Station), a double storey building with nice ambience and great coffee. Latte came with choice of Romeo or Juliet.

It’s in our neighbourhood so we will continue supporting. Was here (Bukit Jalil outlet) with some friends for lunch on a Saturday. A good variety of set lunches that came with miso soup & ice lemon tea, and the best part is one can swap the drinks for beer .. for a small price (top up), of course. Beer came fresh in very chilled mugs & a very happy hour rate. Food (taste wise) is above average, price is OK, beer is fresh & chilled .. will be a repeat customer. The place is decent enough. I was satisfied with the food especially the takoyaki. A few issues though - they got our order wrong twice. The place doesn't seem suitable for large families as the sitting is more suitable for couples with limited seating for larger groups. the pasta is nice, all food with acceptable price. I been here twice, the waitress need to be train, no answer if ask them about the food.A cosy cafe for family and with young kids. Great variety of Japanese and western menu. The price are reasonable and the staff are very friendly, recommended.Their concepts is kinda interesting , blend in with sushi & coffee . Once blend in fusion japanese coffee & sushi+pasta , only things taste is very important. As a food lover i tried out few dishes but couldn't found one is acceptable.. coffee wasn't strong taste as usual cafe.. renovation was standard cafe style. Nice outlet very comfortable relaxing a great place to hang out with friends. The coffee is very good service is really good as well. Read positive feedback on their facebook and was excited to try them out. Honestly price cheap but when get my portion, its horrible small and im a female eater not even half full. Sigh and im paying total bill of rm76.00 with 1main course,1 small salad, 1 horrible box of super thinly slice sashimi for rm19, better buy from topcatch.

I lost rm12 because of ur poor packaging. It spilled at the end. Good Nasi lemak udang... and the nyonya kueh.. a bit pricey but this is KL price. Their Ice Coffee and Ice Tea is good and you can choose the sugar level. 50% sugar is good enough. Not many tables to dine in.Kaw kaw is Malaysian slang for very thick, in reference to coffee made at a kopitiam. You cant use kaw kaw in a Starbucks; double the strength of the caffeine as in an expresso is double shot, not kaw kaw.I visited BKK at Subang Parade because i really love the hot coffee which is prepared kopitiam style. The nasi lemak bungkus is also another attraction but today i decided to try all three, dessert included.The nasi lemak bungkus (so called because it is served in a bungkus or pyramid-like pack and this is the ubiquitous nasi lemak that you find along most Malaysian roadsides where street vendors sell NLB as a To Go breakfast food.BKK's NLB comes at just the right size, not too big as to be filling but petite and easily devoured without wastage. Typically it is served with a half of hard boiled egg, fried anchovies, sliced cucumber and a smothering of hot sambal or chili gravy. To balance the hot dish, i ordered bingka ubi or tapioca sweet delicacy which is a cube of boiled tapoica with a gula melaka top. That done, i downed the hot kopi kaw: wonderful beverage that completed an excellent meal.And guess what? To be consonant with modern times the drink comes with options of sweetness ie how sweet you want it to be. Can you beat that? A kopi in a kopitiam that you need not worry about how sweet it is anymore? I chose the lowest level, 25%, and it was just nice for me as for a sexagenarian, i dont like coffee that tastes like sugar. Usually i order my coffee Panas Jangan Kacau ie hot but not to stir the condensed milk at the bottom, which can be two inches thick!But at BKK, worry no more.",3.5,16,Cafe,Coffee N Tea,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Went to this cafe to meet up with my girl friends for breakfast. There was a morning market in front of the cafe, but the traffic was acceptable, parking was not a hassle.I had their signature Garden breakfast, it came with 2 pieces of thick and delicious toast and green salad.

Although it is a coffee bar, you are served as in a good restaurant. There is a large menu card with drinks but also lots of very interesting dishes! All with pictures. Food style is some sort of western and malaysian fusion dishes. I ordered an oven dish (forgotten the name), which looks very interesting on the menu. I was not disappointed. The food was good. Staff is friendly and professional. Prices are above average compared to a normal coffee shop, but then you can sit and relax an really get served here. I visit this coffee bar yesterday to just cooling down, Just think to have nice coffee at 11 am but suggested by this gentleman to try their French Toast.

Only comparable quality is the Loaf chain of cafes.If you are looking for the real bagels (OK, I heard your protest of ""Define real!""), go to this place quick!Two years ago I was craving for the bagels like those I enjoyed while living in Michigan and New York, and I really had to search around before I finally found this perfect bagel shop right here in KL.My outdated information led me to KLCC but I was disappointed to learn that restaurant was closed. Then I saw bagel in Coffee Bean & Tea Leave menu, and ordered it. My, how disappointed I was to bite on the soft bagel wanna-be.I found bagel recipe online that seemed to be do-able, and my bagels still did not turn out quite right.I almost gave up, and the baby was due soon anyway. Then I tried Bagel Station on a workday -it is 30-min away from work. It was a saver! It was PERFECT. Different flavors of masculine, wholesome bagels - plain, onion, sunflower seeds, poppy seeds, pumpkin seeds, jalapeno (wow!) and everything. I had my first bagel the classic way like I had been fantasizing of for many months now: ""everything with cream cheese"" and it was heavenly! I also had New York Lox (with Salmon) and it was wonderful.Coffee was damn good too. They come with brown sugar. Yeah!This restaurant serves a variety of deserts and they do look mouth-watering. I was too engrossed with my bagels to make room for barely anything else.I had visited this restaurants a few times, some of which with my American husband and he testifies to its heavenly food every time. We tried Mo Meat and it was superb. We love this place! We hope to visit this place often. It's 50km away from home!The customer service is good.

This restaurant had very enthusiastic staff and equally pleasant service when we last visited it,but NOW we were really shocked by the rude,nonchalent,lazy,sleepy waiters who seem unaware of their surroundings...Led by an equally laid back supervisor who seems disinterested to provide service to customers...hardly any diners in fact....just two tables! Took a while and a lot of persuasion before we managed to get them to take our breakfast orders and an equally long wait before food was served.We asked for two glasses of water with our nasi lemak dishes for two,but only one glass of water was served...kept on calling them to serve us another glass,but the foreign waiters and the supervisor looked us in the eye and just ignored the reminders...The saving grace was the fairly good quality of the nasi lemak..! Food 4 stars,Service 0 star....Average rating..2 stars! Not recommended. Without prejudice. The food quality is really lacking. And the whole place wreaks of OLD and poor maintenance. The staff looks old too, even though they are not. Great Malaysian Family dining experience...relaxing casual club house with great dishes like curry fish head, Bean sprouts with salted fish & Lamb Shank Asam Pedas ( a must try ) !! This is the coffee-house of the Bukit Kiara Equestrian Club. There is an air-conditioned dining area and an open-air al-fresco terrace. Overlooking the swimming pool, it offers casual dining in a relaxed atmosphere. There is a weekly themed buffet lunch, hi-teas and dinner. The ala-carte menu includes western as well as local favourites. Great for relaxing with family and friends. Service is friendly and pricing reasonable. If you are visiting as a group, people can be dropped off at the porte cochere first and ample visitor parking can be found about a 100 metre walk away. The Saddle Coffee House has an easy open atmosphere overlooking the swimming pool area. Service is fairly quick and competent and food choices are aplenty. Of particular note is the Mee Rebus, Mee Mamak and the Ayam Percik with Pineapple Fried Rice. Expect to pay about RM25 per person if you're a member of the Bukit Kiara Club and add about 10% more to the bill if you're public.",3.5,5,Cafe,Coffee N Tea,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Great location but the staff was not really interested in us or any one there as they took 10 minutes to come and take our order and the food was very average for the prices. I visited here one Saturday afternoon for a leisurely coffee. I was greeted immediately upon arrival and I indicated I wanted a table outside on the terrace. I was escorted outside and my order taken immediately. Coffee was good and exactly as I ordered and the fries, although hardly difficult to get wrong where delicious and crispy. Staff were friendly and accommodating. We came at lunchtime for a quick bite and were served by someone who must be on her first day. Every question we had regarding the menu had to be directed to someone else, drinks and food were placed very carefully and deliberately at the table, and there was no flexibility. When we tried to order plain pasta with butter for the children, her response was 'I'll have to charge you the same as for the Bolognese.' Same response for a simple sandwich - 'I'll have to charge you for the full sandwich'! But she did smile. After a long and tiring day at Genting Highlands, we can’t go pass Dome.

Depends on individuals.. How you spend them.. Cosy place.. Fit for our family of 6.. See our selections.. We travel the world for food..Been here few times and always in love with their coffee. We have tried few coffee on the menu and all are to our liking by far. Nice ambiance and the staffs are friendly (they can recognize me now in less then 5 visits). Am happy with their desserts. And foods are all okay for me. Nothing bad. Different people, different taste. Some will love it, some might not even like it. It's worth to try anyway. And for muslim, this one big point for them is that they have surau in the cafe. How cool is that? Not many will provide. And am loving them for this. Other than that, they might be overpriced a bit but for me it's worth my penny. All the food ordered sucks big time. It is just normal snacks and most are deep fried but yet it can come up to such low quality food. Coffeemania it's called, but the coffee are simply normal and average. Lots of selection of beans and coffee selection..will come again for sure and the food are splendid!.. especially the grilled chicken.. deserts are mouth watering.. waffles and panna cottas.. great combination with coffee.

Most mornings and evenings we came down to old town to sit outside with a cold drink and some food! Staff are so friendly and amazing prices too!! Your old town white coffee staff name Aslam in KLIA Is very rude! I ordered some cold drinks, I informed him twice at the counter, but he sent hot drinks. He came to me yelling that I ordered hot drinks instead of cold drinks, and asked me to pay for it!!!!!!! But the truth is, it was his mistake that entered as hot drinks for me! He also claimed that the CCTV was there to check that I ordered hot drinks like he told. Well, see for yourself!!! Is it me or his fault. I also can’t used my business class voucher here as the same person, Aslam he couldn’t enter the voucher in system, but most the places to eat or drink listed in the voucher accepted the voucher. Please don’t assigned this kind of super rude people as your staff especially in KLIA. You should at least assess their language skills and the most appropriate way to talk to people! Please take an action immediately. Thanks! I've been a fan of Old Town coffee for a long time now so I was super excited to dine at their restaurant. We ate here twice - 1st at a branch near Paper Plane hostel and the 2nd one at Central Market. The ambiance is quite classy. The prices are pretty steep too but you get good quality of food and service at this place. We ordered various food items such as Nasi Lemak, some noodle dish, a milo drink (super refreshing, super good), some rice meal, and kaya toast. Their kaya toast is quite addicting I order these twice! I went here with my son on my last trip to KL and we ordered white coffee with hazelnut flavour... iced for my son and hot for me. This coffee is out of the world.. loveed it. Missed buying their premix coffee packs and now looking online for the same. We ordered some soupy noodle oriental stuff to eat (cant recollect the name) but it wasn’t good.. it had too much of a ‘fishy’ smell to it. So I recommend to try the coffee and if you wana eat then keep your order simple and order only what you know! For a quick meal fix this is where we go. The kaya bread is nothing to rave about but im here for the white coffee and teh tarik.we love some of the noodle offerings too..we also appreciate quick service. Stopped by for a quick coffee and teh tarik on the first day in Kuala Lumpur. One has to write the orders one wants on a piece of paper by using codes listed. Normal kopitiam, nothing special to shout about. This Kopitiam have improved their service tremendously. New breakfast combo is value for money. Tried the Nasi Lemak which was good. The anchovies could improve a bit more. The coffee was just right.",3,77,Cafe,Coffee N Tea,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Located in the heart of an abundance of lush greenery within a glass house, this cafe has long been one of our favourites. Business meeting, a gossip session with the girls or some quiet time with a book and a cup of coffee, they had you  covered. But can they perform similarly for a delivery? Taste: Despite being grilled, the skin of the rosemary chicken was slightly charred but was extremely fragrant and juicy within unlike some that arrive dry. The grilled vegetables and tomatoes were garden fresh and crunchy to the bite. The accompanying brown sauce was slightly salty on its own but perfect when paired with the chicken. Unfortunately, the mash potatoes were a little powdery and dry. A cafe aptly and simply named POKOK but already created such a buzz among foodies and social media influencers alike.And it took me a while before finally making my way there. Parking spot is available at an open air parking outside the campus and one has to walk into the campus to access the cafe. When you spot the standalone structure made with red bricks, glass and steel... With a lot of people enjoying their lunch, you'd know that you've come to the right place.Not wanting to eat alfresco style due to the scorching heat, we opted to wait for the next available table indoor. Since we were there for lunch, natural lighting aka the sunlight was all they need to brighten up the whole space.. as even the roof is glass. Everyone was seen tucking into their hearty meal and we quickly placed our order.Rosemary Grilled Whole Chicken Leg with truffle mash, roasted pumpkin and toasted cauliflower. Perfectly done with fall-off-the-bone texture and crispy skin while maintaining its juicy and tender meat.Baked Farm - lamb albondigas, cirspy beef bacon and sausage chunks in tomato puree topped with shaved parmesan and 2 poached eggs. We requested for the beef to be omitted and they obliged. Come during peak hours and high chances that you might have to wait for tables. We were made to wait for about 20 minutes before being able to fill our fungry tummies.If you have an eye or knack for good photos, this place presents quite a lot of opportunities.",3,32,Cafe,Coffee N Tea,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Ok food for quick brunch in Bangsar.. We only had fish and salted egg chicken strips forr brunch. Nothing fantastic, just food to fill up the stomach. The cakes that were displayed, look really stale and there were only once piece left for each and not sure how long they have left it for. Did not look appetising so we dropped the idea of having the cake. Never try their food but the coffee's are really good. Service quite fast but do expect some crowd due to the location. Food was ok but salty to my palate. Environment was chilling. Iced cold brew black coffee and latte were alright. Quite good service. Food was ok. Surprisingly good Cajun chicken, just a little bit over salty. And was quite disappointing about the sizzling coconut nangka brownie. Even was let down by the food. However I'm giving extra marks for the service. Because one of us are using the wheel chair. Those little helpful and caring service was giving by the staffs, I felt that. Good food. Decent sized portions. Salted egg yolk chicken was yummy. So were the calamari and spicy chicken. Spaghetti bolognese ok. Duck carbonara was also tasty. I had the spring noodle bowl which was simple but nice. Lamb shoulder was a huge portion. Also tasty. Pizza was nice but lots of cheese and could be more inspired. Prices and service ok. They serve alcohol. Cakes after 10pm are 50% off. I like the ambience. It super chill and the deco is fascinating but I think they have to add more fan at the outdoor areas as it feels very warm and sweaty. The menu are little too pricey. Their staff are friendly and helpful. Just super disgust with some customer who treat the place like mamak.

However , there seems to be double standards in terms of service . As I purchase breakfast and was solo , I notice that the waitress or waiters sometimes serve breakfast to the table for some customers, they don’t. For me it is really inconvenient , as I am sitting alone and they call me collect my breakfast, when I got back to my table , my table was taken up by an unsuspecting customer. They also didn’t clear the tray from the previous customer that sat before me . I had to move to another smaller table as I gave way to that customer. I observed that the waiter did notice my table was too small and my breakfast tray was occupying a lot of the table space, they did not do anything even though they were free. I have to specifically call the waiter over to clear my table. This might seem petty but I really feel disappointed in the service. Another thing is there needs to have no wash basin for customers to wash their hands before and after a meal. Would only come here only because the coffee and the menu selection is wider than Starbucks , anyways I have other branches to go in terms of Coffee Bean.

The latest addition to the VCR portfolio, VCR Stacks in Shoplex Mont Kiara highlights two things they do exceptionally well – sourdough bread and coffee. And, judging by the steady stream of customers, this narrow focus serves them well.Roasting their own beans and baking their own sourdough, the team had earned such a reputation for quality that they were supplying several cafes besides their own around the city. VCR Stacks combines these two products in a café dedicated to sandwiches and brew. This new concept focuses on “stacks of carbs,” says partner Kenneth Lee, with their house-made sourdough layered with a variety of sweet and savoury combos. Co-owner and chef, Ivan Koh has spent the past six years perfecting their sourdough and today bake seeded, Japanese rye, ciabatta and brioche loaves. The same starter is given a second chance of life in their waffles too!While there are a handful of other items such as granola bowls and waffles on the menu, the primary focus at VCR Stacks is sandwiches.Egg Sando (RM 15) on brioche might be one of the most enticing egg sandwiches I’ve come across. A free-range soft-boiled egg is immediately attractive bulging out the sides of fat slices of house-made sourdough brioche. Sliced egg mayo, chives, celery and dill bulk the rest. Zen Stacks (RM 22) provides a veg option with pan-fried halloumi, feta, tomato, confit portobello, pesto hummus and arugula on rye sourdough. It’s rich with the pesto hummus, which again is made from scratch. All sandwiches are lightly spread with French Maison Le Gall butter and toasted to achieve a mild crunch and golden hue.An excellent lunch option is found in the Classic Chicken (RM 22). A generous supply of thigh meat is coated in creamy mustard mayonnaise (with celery, chives and dill) on their signature seed sourdough. Inside there’s avocado mash, toasted walnuts, arugula and spinach. Have to confess to having a huge avo bias so this one could be my fave. Coming soon to the menu is the Pastrami Reuben (RM 24). House-roasted black Angus pastrami is the star here with house-fermented sauerkraut running a close second. The sauerkraut has just the right amount of tanginess to keep us biting back in again and again.Lastly, if you have a sweet tooth, you would do well to try the Nut Butter Jelly (RM 18). VCR Stacks’ seeded sourdough is spread with a lusciously thick blanket of house-made almond, cashew and coffee butter (so good – they sell it by the jar but are always out!). Together with locally grown and processed chocolate, house-made blueberry jam and candied walnuts, it is one luscious chew.",4.8,603,Cafe,Coffee N Tea,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Apart from a convenient location to meet up, me and my friends always loved the atmosphere we got from the store. Highly recommended good food served moreover, the staff is always friendly and helpful towards us. No doubt one of the best coffee I’ve had in town as well. Overall I would give full 5 star rating for this place. Did not forget to mention also that they serve craft beer too! Rare to find around town. This place has now been renamed ""Meet Joe"" (because of their poor service too?) First things first. The service is horrible. The waiters either don't seem to understand English, or they are ignoring you. Ordered one thing, but served something else. Not sure if it's coz ALL the workers are immigrants - look like Bangladeshis or something. Another thing is the drinking water that's served is NON-FILTERED water, with a very STRONG TASTE of CHLORINE! Personally, I've NEVER expected that chlorinated water will be served in any such cafeterias or restaurants, especially considering the prices one is paying. Never going to go back there again! Wide range and good quality of food and desserts. Every table has charge point and many tables for people looking to work for a couple hours. Great staff. Very popular but unfortunately left disappointed. Servings of both meals and juices are so small for the price you pay. My toast and the poached eggs were cold. Has so much potential but I wouldn’t go back. I’m here right now having my early dinner consists of Croque Madame which has increased priced to rm30. Omg so expensive for 6thinly sliced roast beef sandwich between 2slices of toasted multigrain, served on very minimal cheese and side salad. Roast beef is tender and nice but ojo, u could use some more cheese and beef as you are charging rm30, not rm20. I will not order this dish again as it’s overpriced. 2nd dish which I order is the Dutch baby pancake which is yummy. Pls be aware it need 20mins to prepare its crispy fluffy pancake served with 2slices of Norwegian smoked salmon with avocado and a sunny side up egg @ rm18. Portion wise for the dishes are enough for 1person only. If you’re are big eater like me, it’s not sufficient. Had the recommended cake by a Indian male server, their chocolate cheese cake with salted caramel nuts @ rm14. The cakes biscuit and the crunchy bits are really good with the creamy cheese top with the caramel nuts are to die for. I sat outside and drank a very good coffee with the best piece of cake in Kuala Lumpur. The people were very nice and welcome. I would come back to this place. When you look for a nice cafe where you can not only have an excellent coffee, but also a good variety of fresh juices and a food menu with a wide selection really nice food where both non vegetarians and vegetarians will be very happy. There is also a good WiFi connection, hence you see lots of people using OJO as there communication hang-out. The only minus point is the music. Of course this is personal, but I think it is really too loud and I also think there is music nicer for the ear.",3,15,Cafe,Coffee N Tea,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Coffee Box’s head chef David strives to channel a personal touch in these recipes, enhanced with elements like Lady’s Choice Real Mayonnaise, which David credits for a subtle boost of both flavour and texture to make each preparation extra enjoyable. The cafe’s signature curry laksa (RM11.50) is laced with this mayo to ensure the flavoursome broth boasts a light smoothness, while the crispy fish and chips comes with a perky coleslaw with a quality mayo base for mildly sweet, lemony notes (RM15.90). The mayo also comes in very handy for infusing into rich, creamy sauces in fowl temptations like the elaborate chicken roulade with honey mustard sauce and a baked potato (RM19,90) and tender chicken with butter sauce and rice (RM17.90 in a value set with iced lemon tea), as well as a can’t-fail dip for French fries to munch on (RM6.30). Coffee Box performs reasonably for other cherished local staples – chef David takes pride in delivering a fairly priced fragrant nasi lemak with curry chicken and all the requisite accompaniments (RM12.90) and a hearty char kuey teow blanketed in egg and peppered with prawns and cockles (RM12.90).

Service was also quick and friendly. The food here is very fresh and the chapati, naan and protha are very flavourful. A must try is their tandoori chicken, mutton kheema and butter chicken. The mango lassi and plain lassi are our favourites. Always enjoy the parathas and bitter guard veggie. Place offers authentic north Indian flavors at a very reasonable price. Restaurant ambience is very basic and gives a local Indian budget restaurant feel. But the tasty food is only reason for my regular visits. they gave me burn naan intentioanally. I went there from 10 km distance to bring parcel but they cheated as i did not see what they had packed in the parcel and finally when i opened the parcel at my place, saw black color burnt naam which no one can eat. Authentic Punjabi food in Brickfields Kuala Lampur. Quick service and friendly staff. Buffet system has good variety. Buffet is generally cheaper than ala carte. Good restaurant with veg and non veg choice ,curd papad etc.Its one type of self service system still hotel boys serve some items in between .Drinking water in glass supplied free. If you are in KL and you want to have Indian food go there Great serving Excellent food and portions is thier hallmark I ate almost daily from there when I was there. Nice place to have authentic north Indian food. The food is really good and tasty. Secondly the price is very reasonable and it does not burn a whole in the pocket. Worth visiting the place if you are craving for real Indian food.",4,85,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Lucky for us, we managed to get the only table available as we were early for lunch. The restaurant was really full. I would say that N&B is not very vegetarian friendly and there is only one vegetarian item, the pumpkin linguine. As hubby is vegetarian, so there is not much of a choice for him. I chose the percik burger, grilled marinated chicken on brioche bun, a Merdeka special. It was good and i enjoyed it though it took really a long time to be served and hubby almost finished his pasta before my burger made an appearance. The restaurant is very noisy and wait staff is quite slow and rather difficult to catch their attention when service is needed. Went to Naj & Belle (in Bangsar) to celebrate a dear friend's birthday and realized that we were not the only ones doing that. As we opened the door and strode into this cozy restaurant, and as if on cue, one table burst into 'Happy Birthday to you'. A waitress was stepping forth with an array of colorful desserts with a singular candle on one of them. And throughout the evening, one table after another, the same thing happened. After a quiet lull, full-throated singing followed by applause. We ordered Persian Medley that came with a lamb shank, slices of grilled marinated chicken on a bed of rice with almond slices and other nuts; Nasi Goreng Ulam Ayam Bakar and Linguini Creamy Pesto Carbonara which the birthday girl wanted to lick the plate clean. We asked for a spatula instead. For dessert, Watermelon Cake (YES!), Gianduja Cake Rose Lychee Almond Cake, Burnt Cheesecake and the Deconstructed Pavlova. My favorites...Watermelon Cake and the well-constructed Deconstructed Pavlova, with a ton of whipped cream. To top the whole evening off, the owner Belle came to our table...unsolicited. Warm and friendly, she made her recommendations of other dishes we should try on our next outing. When she caught me looking for more small dessert plates, she went and got them herself. Yes, the place was abuzz with patrons, chatting, eating and drinking and all at some point in the evening sang Happy Birthday to...Somebody. All were having a great time, even though not eating what we were eating. Very crowded. So should make reservations before going esp if you go in big group. I tried their burnt cheese, but I would not say it is one of the best in town. Everything is good Here latest menu for your reference and planning Lunch on weekday are very crowded but still comfort for who wish to have a great gathering. Love the atmosphere,service and food. Food isn't expensive and worth it. Will definitely come back for more.",4,31,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

We must have been the first customers of the day, because upon walking in, chairs were still up on the table and the music was blaring. Once seated, someone turned the music down a little. Still, it took far too long to attract our waiter's attention. While we were eating, the staff started to take the chairs down in the most noisy possible way. The roti was alright, no sambal in sight to speak of. In the end, we paid our bill and left. I'd the place next door over this one. They were full to capacity for a reason! Went to eat lunch here, ordered char kuey teow. It tasted kind of sweet and wet. V long strips of carrot and vegetables too as garnish. They still serve breakfast at dinner time? That is soo Malaysian! I just ate 'Roti Bom' and it was just as crispy and fluffy as how I like them to be. Perfectly made (not too sweet). I ordered oglio olio and need to wait for more than 15 minutes for that eventhough there's lack of custumer ..not recomended for anyone who hungry and need to rush..i have asked for chili flake but staff told me no chili flakes..but once my oglio olio almost finished the staff give me chili flakes without a word..seriously?? The price is average. It is not that expensive here. We ate here cause this is the only restaurant open in the morning that offers not only Malaysian food. I ordered here the American breakfast. Their Teh Tarik was the best, I loved the Iced version of it so you better try that out. This restaurant is conveniently located next to the station. Seating available inside the restaurant and outside as well. Nice variety of food and their Fried Rice is very tasty. As a loner I did not felt alone as the staff was very friendly and attentive. Compared to the other recent reviews, I have to say I was quite happy with the food, mostly because: 1) I went there for Iftar, where I was starving anyway and 2) Not many people were in the restaurant so service was fas. Working at Plaza Sentral give more variety of food choice and when you were there more than 3 years ..... you kinda familiar with type of restaurant in this area. For me just average mamak in the mall. If i have to choose for the price i would go to Nu Sentral Food Court more food to choose for the same price of Nasi Campor and Briani. After several time eating there, service always slow and you have to check and call the waiter more than 2 times.",3,27,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Dim Sum was good, as with all Oriental group. The location was difficult to find, mainly coz the entire mall had shut down and unless you have been recommended, no one will visit. The crowd was about 40% full, likely to be existing customers.  Decent food with fair service. Challenge is to get in due to closure of most parts of the mall. Otherwise no complaints, dinner is equally good. Maju palace offers a wide spread of delicious halal dim sum. Their service are good and the portion of their food are quite I have to say, generous. Also, their price are reasonable. Please make reservation before you come. They do have regular lunch crowd. Especially on Fridays. Its hard enough to find halal dimsum in KL city, and this place serves authentic dim sum cuisine. Very tasty and worth every penny. Service was good too. This is a halal Chinese restaurant where the food is really good. The food ranges from dimsum to ala carte to set. Place is out of the way but still accessible via the Green LRT line. From the LRT station, you will be on a covered walkway all the way to the mall and restaurant. I would recommend this place if you are looking for Dim Sum. I must say given it is halal dimsum, it is pretty good, though I can't say this for the fried stuffs. The steamed dimsum are good. It can be really packed during lunch time, but they do take reservations. Price is very reasonable. Been here few times for business lunch. Good taste, environment, and service but a bit pricey.

The Indian vegetarian food here is very good and tasty. Staff are friendly and helpful. It's a small cosy and busy restaurant. Unfortunately you lost one star from me, because the air conditioning was not working and it was hot there. I would like to share my experience from today evening, I have ordered a food via Food Panda exactly at 19:44 till 22:07 my order has not been realised. I made a call to restaurant at 21:36 and asked them when my order will be ready. One of staff replied that my food has been picked up by driver, I have texted a driver - unfortunately no response. I called again to restaurant and told them that I don't have any contact with a driver and a person from Ganga Cafe said that they cannot help me, and next time I should use Grab Food instead of Food Panda. I was waiting another 20 minutes and suddenly the restaurant called me with information that driver picked up a wrong order. Honestly, this is so silly excuse and so unprofessional service, waiting over 2 hours without any information from restaurant that the order can delay, this is not a good service at all!!! Disappointed. This place was busy and seems popular - mostly foreigners. The food however was nothing special. The vegetarian biriyani was nice, but everything else a bit dull. Watery dhal (almost like rasam), and ordinary palak paneer. The paratha was actually more like a roti North Indian style. Too much flavor of cardamom and cinnamon. I must prefer south Indian veg food - mustard seed and curry leaves. Service was fine. Went for Sunday buffet lunch and the food offering this round with a bit more varieties of food but the price also increase too. Taste wise is good and now there is an improvement on customer service. Last time they provide better service to foreign or white customers but now it seems we local get the same service. With the slight increase in price, it justify that there is a bit more dishes been offered therefore it fair for the increase in price. Hope the management will keep up with the food quality and provide same customer service level. If price cheap and food good and lousy customer service, people will not go back again. Hope the standard of food and service will remain. My freinds recommended., freshly made veg indian food. piping hot food, freindly staff. owner herself supervises everything. she was there and made some spl food for children.highly recommended. bharat their other restaurand next to this is also v.good. it serves vegitarian thai and pizza,pasta.",4,177,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

We sat on the enjoyed the buffet with coffee beef so delicious for today lunch. Must try! I love this restaurant so much, it's like buffet, just pay for RM 35 then you will be free to take every foods, Waaa the best. This outlet is definitely worth a visit. The grill and steamboat are provided individually and you can have your own individual pot at a very nominal fee. The varieties of food are definitely more than other outlets with our favourites consisting of the seafoods.... fish,prawns and squids. The chicken ginseng soup is not bad here. Food is fresh and the service is pretty good. Hi i'm dining at your branch at setapak central last night. I'm happy with the service provided especially from indian staff. You just have to add a menu on dessert. oustanding customer service. varieties of fresh korean taste. great ambience. we enjoyed ourselves here. free for kids below twelve on Sunday. far more better than pak john steamboat. highly recommended.

Not bad especially the biriani. The daal & the naan were good too. But the place didn't look hygienic. Location too isn't desirable. Ambience very ordinary. Prices were way too much. Try their beriani and garlic cheese nan. Really awesome food . excellent service. Due to massive urbanisation the parking is limited. Today i visited this place, food was amazing... It really have our tradition taste.. Biryani was mindbowling... Cheez Nan , Mango Juice... Everything have perfect taste and perfectly served. Plan to visit often. We came to try this place out since it was highly rated by our Pakistani friends. This place could accommodate a large group. Overall cleanliness was ok. Indoor seating with a/c. The food was amazing!! We ordered a big dish of chicken biryani which was the star! The chicken was well cooked in the biryani masala and rice was perfect..Apart from that we also ordered butter chicken, lamb shank, chicken tandoori which were all good! The chicken tandoori,unlike other Indian Muslim restaurants which serve theirs with red food coloring added to the chicken, this was just the spices and it was succulent, well marinated..the kids loved their rich cheese naan..we also ordered their tarka daal which was really good and spicy. Fruit juices were pure and not watered down,we ordered watermelon and pineapple juice. The best was their mango lassi. I highly recommend this restaurant to all biryani lovers..u won’t be disappointed! Me and my wife are frequent visitor to KL and will come to this Pakistan restaurant almost every time (may be close to 10 times), but never have a chance to write a review (perhaps too lazy). Honestly, this restaurant remind us the delicious Indian cuisine when we visited Srinagar Kashmir last summer - mutton masala, butter chicken... and so on. Definitely recommend to those who love curry and naan type of food. Rather strange despite it's delicious food, every time the restaurant is so quiet, and I hope it will survive, otherwise it would be a pity if without such a good ethnic restaurant in KL. Tucked away off Jalan Imbi ( not so easily located) is a great Pakistan Restaurant. Environment may be so so , but that’s where great food are usually found. Try the lamb curry, naan both plain & garlic, tandoori chicken, kheema, beriani rice , butter chicken, chickpeas, mango lassi and if course masala tea ! Couldn’t be better. Go for it and all the way. Drop by for lunch after reading about this restaurant. We love to try all types of food from all ethnic groups. This is one of the better restaurant we ate in recently. The lamb beriani was done perfectly, the thin long grain rice absorbed the flavor well with just enough spices to make every mouthful a pleasure. The cheese naan was awesome, made with a flavorful dough that is moist and delicious. The mango lassi was made from fresh mango. The masala tea was also well made with a good blend of different spices.",4.5,35,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Next the roti cheese is very soft and cheesy. It came along with dal which tasted really good.The masala tea is not that good as it contained too many spices but the water melon juice is very relaxing. We are missing potato curry and so we ordered one and it tasted awesome. They have a table outside with cups + masala tea for 1RM.Since I was staying in the area I used to drink 3/4 per day.One day I had a Thali.The only good thing was potato so after that I used to order Masala dosai as a snack.This review is for Ravi's at USJ19. Lunch on Mutton Peratal Briyani rice and was down with a teh tarik. The Mutton Peratal had a good spice flavour however the Mutton could simmer longer to tender. Might try their famous banana leaf rice next visit.Their roti canai was excellent,soft fluffy and when dipped in their delightful dhall curry,the taste was great...used to be served on a banana leaf before,but lately on a metal plate.oh dear me! I stay nearby in Mont kiara and this used to be my regular breakfast food until lately. The service is the worst ever,lazy noisy waiters only interested in talking amongst themselves in loud loud Tamil....you can sit patiently to give your order waving your arm,waiters will look you in the eye and then continue with their chat....really frustrating...But when the lady boss is around .. hallelujah!....

We found the ingredients to be fresh and the dishes generally well prepared. ervice and ambience is excellent. The price point is fair for an upscale restaurant. e will be back to try more dishes but for now, this will be our go to place for Chinese food in Damansara Heights. This is an expensive area of KL generally, but Decanter keeps prices fairly reasonable. The food is reliable, if not brilliant. Local options are decent enough. Drinks can be improved. I'd give it 3.63 stars, how's that for precision? My wife's Nephew took us out for lunch and brought us here. Very pleased with the food and service, not sure why the other reviews are not so good, but I also notice that these are some 4 years or older, so perhaps the place has improved since then, but I would certainly recommend them! The menu features both local and Western food. The Hainanese chicken chop was quite nice, the portion was generous. Someone had the pasta with no complaints. The kitchen is halal, but they do serve alcohol and had Guinness stout on tap, which those drinking said was quite authentic. Overall a good meal. Still the best local restaurant in damansara heights Food is good fast and tasty The service polite friendly and efficient. You cannot go wrong at Decanter's . They got it down to a pat. D for Delicious. D for Delectable. D for Do eat here again! The pasta was to Die for. So was the Nasi Goreng Indonesia, the Grilled Chicken Chop and the Club Sandwich.

Satay sauce is good and you can choose to add their signature sambal chilli to the sauce. Average looking cafe, but don't let that put you off. The satay was amazing. Go for the food, not the atmosphere. We came on recommendation of a local acquaintance. The restaurant looked fairly full, there were signs that seemed to indicate more seating upstairs. There were no lights in the stairwell and using our phones we established that section was closed. No one bothered trying to stop us from going up there or indeed welcoming us in. Once that misunderstanding was over, we did take over a table from people who were leaving. No one in the establishment spoke English and almost none of the signs were in English either. We worked out you have to go and order and pay for the satay and it's brought to you when it's ready. Our Malaysian speaking friend arrived and then all was well. There's a good variety of satay to order, including fish and rabbit. Rice, cucumber and peanut sauce keep coming so long as you order satay. Everything tasted great and I would recommend this place to anyone, especially those hoping to practice the local language! Finally got to sample different satay on offer. Very nice peanut sauce, we enjoyed both food & drinks. Like many local restaurants, they do not have air conditioning. Sate Kajang, the best and most authentic sate. Haji Samuri has a few branches and they produce consiatently good delicious sate. I love the chicken and lamb sate. The best part is the sauce. The thick, flavoursome peanut sauce is mixed with a delicious hot sambal, a combination that not only taste good with the flavourful sate but also adds a kick to the whole experience. Normally you will get a big proportion of fatty meats in the sate, but this Sate kajang is lean and tasty. Had lunch here twice over the past week. They have a choice of chicken, beef, beef tripe, rabbit, fish and chicken liver and gizzard satays. The satay is served with a big platter of cucumber and onions. There is also a selection of different style fried rice and mee bandung. The satays are well grilled and tasty and the sauce thick and not too sweet. We also like the nasi goreng kampung. All Malaysian loves sate, especially when you enjoy it along with Nasi kapik & ketupat. Fresh cucumber and some even fresh charlottes. First time to this place, the satay is not hot either warm. The sauce not that great. A lot of people but it is not up to my standards of satay. They need to improve the food quality.",4,36,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

The Teh Tarik comes in a generous mug size and is absolutely delicious. They also serve freshly squeezed juices and combine flavors without adding sugar. The service was fast. It is a simple restaurant but worth going in to have a drink. There is an interesting range of food served at this restaurant. Some are unique to Malaysia and some can be new to patrons. Try their Laksa Johor or Soto Ayam. Love the gravy of both so much! The KOPI-O and Teh Tarik are signature beverages here. The atmosphere is very casual and they have a reasonable food choice too.

There is also not much of a crowd hence you can hangout peacefully. It's out in the open on main Bukit Bintang. The music can get really loud sometimes and the food is just average. The staff is courteous though. People mainly come here for the sheesh, not the food. Always go there for the best chicken kabsa in bukit bintang...HUGE portions, one person just cannot finish the kabsa. Also the chicken sheesh kebab is yummy and it comes with a pita wrap, naan pieces and french fries!!!!. The kebab in itself is a full meal!!! All in all great food with good ambiance and friendly service makes for a verrry happy evening!! dropped by Tajiine in Bukit Bintang and ordered hummus lamb and mango lassi. the hummus was thick and drenched with olive oil. The hot bread that came with it tasted awesome, especially when dipped into the hummus. My palate was singing when lamb, hummus and bread went down my throat in harmony: hot bread covered with hummus with chunks of lamb is a devastating combination. The mango lassi was excellent, cool and juicy with the distinct mango flavour. All in all, a hearty dinner, and the bonus was finding the MRT Bukit Bintang right at the restaurant's doorstep! Outstanding experience, I visited this restaurant last evening for dinner, I had Tajine chicken and I was very delicious, I would definitely recommend it. Gd atmosphere with catchy middle-east tunes. Service wise is ok. Had their watermelon-mint shisha, arabian teapot and pizza(forgot the type we had). Located just next to the exit/entrance of Bukit Bintang station. Hye there, i like your place, just cool n nice place but please take care and improve about your service.. ling time to take the sugar i request for my coffee.. warm regret and thank you. The food, I believe its Lebanese, are delicious with varieties of typical middle eastern favorites on the menu. Quite a large portion for a single person to guzzle it down.

Food quality was good. Should work on the taste part of non veg dishes. Friendly staff. They served ice cream after the dinner which was appreciated. the food is tasty. my son ordered chicken chop. the meat is so juicy. they cater western food too. the juices are delicious. This is a restaurant located just behind Chennai Express in Sentul. The location is very strategic as the bus station is just less than 100 meter from this shop & there are railway station which is not so far from this shop. This shop is also located at the ground of the condominium. The atmosphere is good with air-conditioner room & with table & chairs for 5 - 6 peoples to sit at one time. The price will be slightly more than normal restaurant but it is good for those who would like to have a lunch or dinner once in a while especially if you would like to have a treat for a celebration or any other event in your family. You need around RM10-RM15 for a basic lunch per person & less than RM10 for basic dinner per person. The drinks such as juices prices will be at least RM5. During lunch, you may have banana leaf food. You may try both vegetarian & non-vegetarian food here. For hindus, there is a temple within walking distance from here & also indian cinema. If you wish to pray or go for a movie after lunch or dinner, you don't have to worry about transportation as both places are just within walking distance in less than 5 minutes. Banana leaf is recommended due to variety of thali dishes. Clean and air conditioned place, ideal for family meal. Should not give it a miss if in this part of the world.

Overdue review! When I was in Malaysia, one of the things I didn’t miss was enjoying satay from Malaysia. Oh boy, I missed it so much! My family and relatives decided to order satay from here and eat at home. They didn’t mess around, they ordered about a hundred satay to go, both chicken and beef. I went to pick it up with my cousin because I wanted to see this popular place. Whatever that they used to marinade the satay was a big deal to me, best ingredients! You must try this “highly recommended mouth watering” satay! When I arrived at the place I saw a house, well, it looked like a house. While waiting for them to finish making the satay, I went inside the house to see the entire place. If you decide to dine here, you have a choice of dining inside the house either in a private room or a non-private room but both sections allow you to eat on the floor like how you would experience eating in a village home. If you decide to dine outside the house, the outside seating is a regular table and chair dining style. We chose to eat at our relative’s home so no need to worry about all this. They packed the to-go satay very neatly, in a box. The staffers at the station were pretty good in keeping customers informed. They’re also very friendly and happy. I can’t keep talking about this because I miss it already. They nailed it! I have had satay approximately 10 times around KL and this place by far is the cleanest I have experienced. The grill is nice and the environment is very clean. They have a nice selection of non-alcoholic beverages for a hot day and their meat is very flavorful. They are reasonably priced for what you are receiving and the quality they serve. You can find cheaper, but you also get what you pay for too! We had a sudden craving for satay and our last minute googling on satay paid off! We found this branch of satay station situated at the quiet part of tasik titiwangsa. They offered 2 types of satay for chicken and beef ( bigger chunky ones and normal sized ones) at difference price ). The satays were superb with the perfect cuts and ratio of charred fats bits and the lean parts. The fats literally just melt in our mouths. The peanut sambal gravy was delicious with the right amount of spices and peanut bits. My friend spotted ' hot nasi lemak' In the menu and couldn't resist and ordered one . Boy ! It was a hit and it got gobbled down like in seconds . When the nasi lemak arrived at our table we immediately got the whiff of fresh santan from the piping hot rice. The sambal was tasty with the right amount of anchovies. It was so satisfying that we ordered a second helping. Being greedy, I ordered a bowl of sup daging it was delicious , too! Why aren't everyone flocking here to taste the food here? I guess the satay price is one of the factors as the standard big chunky ones for mutton costs one RM 3.50 per stick and about RM 2.50 for the beef and chicken . It was about RM 1.30-1.80 per stick for the budgeted sticks which to me are just fine . In a nutshell , I would definitely come back for the food as this stall is severely underrated .",4,31,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Some of their products like the soft serve and hot chocolate are no longer served. Food prices are reasonable, and for their signature chicken chop, they have it in mini (RM9.90) and regular (RM17++). Having the mini itself is. Myself my wife and son atr at the cafe and ordered food for delivery for our hungry 20pax of friends. The food was consistent and the food delivered was neatly packed. Thoughtful thinking with extra bowls for the soupy noodles. Everyone enjoyed their dinner. Will definitely order again! I came here to try their ice creams. Was not offered taste test ... I should have asked for it. The durian gelato is decent but the nangka (nangka) was a total waste of money which pulled down its ratings in my mind a lot. It shouldn’t even be on the menu... it doesn’t have any taste of nangka at all unlike the creations by inside scoop. We were told of the delicious chicken chop and laksa at Charlie’s Cafe so decided to give it a go. Ordered the Sarawak laksa- don’t expect authentic Sarawak laksa, this is their own version and a good fix; curry laksa- very spicy and you may want to ask for the sambal on the side; chicken chop- deep fried goodness; durian soft serve ice cream- amazing and the UFO tart. Clean, simple, no frills, friendly and easy on the wallet. Definitely a keeper. Cosy, simple food here. Have visited Charlie”s cafe for the 3rd time and I always love to order their grilled chicken with black pepper sauce. Black pepper sauce always good and grilled chicken chop are done right as still juicy. Had fried chicken chop with mushroom sauce for my daughter. She loves juicy fried chicken, reason being chicken are fried or cook ala minute. Chicken chop are charged at RM17.90 each with greens, mashed and coleslaw. At Charlie’s Cafe, they don’t served French fries anyone as the owner said, his majority customer requested for mashed potatoes than French fries. Food here are average and it’s not the wow kind. A friend brought me there for dinner. She recommended me to try their chicken chop and laksa Sabah. I chose chicken chop. You get to choose whether to fry or grill your chicken and you also get to choose your sauce of choice. I got cheese. The portion was enough, the ingredient was fresh, nicely cooked and plated. It was a healthy meal. They cook the dishes when someone orders it, so it's very fresh. You do need to wait a little for the food to be served. They serve desserts too. Do try their Sandakan UFO tarts and also durian icecream. This cafe does charity too. They donate food to Robin Hood Army KL to minimize food wastage. If you visit them, you can also do your part. They have another form of givng back and you can pay RM5 for a receipt. You stick the receipt to the wall and whoever in need of a meal can walk in and take a free meal you paid in advance. Do check them out if you are nearby Taman Bukit Desa. They take pride in service especially the owner who tries her best with each customer. One can't really fault the service. We tried the sarawak laksa, nasi lemak rendang & chicken chop - everything was average really - I expected more from the laksa - there wasn't enough stuff for the price one pays. What is lovely is the home made ice cream / gelato by the owner - there is the durian soft scoop which is really popular with customers & I particularly loved the nangka gelato! Although a little pricey, it is supposed to be homemade after all. If the main courses were better, it would have got 4 stars.",3.5,29,Cafe,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

From starter to main dishes to dessert. My friends and I enjoyed the food a lot. The place is located at level 2, The Linc KL. It is very nice place. The staffs were very helpful and attentive. The service is very good. I love the ambience but am not sure how to describe it. It is colorful, crowded yet peaceful. Felt like surrounded by 'Gianni Versace' all over the places ^_^ Food is average but the presentation is superb. We paid very much on its brand image, not the foods. The set menu we ordered was well served for a family. We had 3 different rices - nasi minyak, nasi putih and nasi Terengganu. The kerabu pomelo with prawn was something new for us. The four main dishes were just alright - asam pedas, udang masak lemak and sambal sotong, but kambing kuzi can be better. A bit pricey. The staff were super professional! The food was delicious, the serving was neat, the setting was simple but inviting, the ambience was lovely and the deco inside and outside of the restaurant was beautiful. Not forgetting the staff were polite and friendly. I went with my friend and we absolutely love the dining experience at De.Wan. Staffs are attentive and willing to explain the menu. Everything taste superb, Malay food at its finest! Really love the elegant decor. Portions are big and can feed 3-4 pax per dish. the meal was just okay. nothing impressive about the taste.what's appaling is I ordered orange juice but they actually pour it out of a ""Peel Fresh"" orange juice. That is not right especially when someone as esteemed as Chef Wan is the one who owned the restaurant. but the service and ambience is impeccable. Our first fine dining experience in Malaysian celebrity chef restaurant was a let down . We had booked a private dining room for our friends 50th birthday for a table of 14 and had flown in from overseas . We decided to go with the top set menu which was to cater for 12 people . We had 2 young kids so we knew it was going to be more than enough . We requested to change the spicy seafood soup as some cannot take spice . The waitress was quite reluctant to do so . Who is the customer ! If you cannot take spice then we would waste it anyway . We didn’t ask to pay less . We just wanted some soup to be another type that they had in the lesser price set menu so we can enjoy ourselves.. The main courses all came at once , sitting there getting cold as you can’t eat them all at the same time . We hadn’t even finished and the waitress started clearing our plates . We are paying fine dining prices and it’s like they wanted us out ASAP . The good quality was inconsistent . Some dishes especially the seafood ones were overcooked . The only good thing was the private room had nice decor . I would not recommend this place for a fine dining experience in KL. Best malay dishes. Very authentic and the ingredients use to cook each dishes are detailed and complete. Superb taste, excellent environment. One of the best dining experience I had in Kuala Lumpur. From different colored rice, seafood, chicken, lamb, everything was just amazing.. will definitely try a second time.",4,25,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Limited selection of food and beverages yet it is good for expectation for silent floor for families to gather. We came for dinner. It was a buffet featuring 'Crab' evening so a wide selection of shrimps and crab food was available. The food selection was rich, quality excellent, taste great. The staff was maybe the biggest asset - attentive, smiling, helpful. The desserts were a real treat. An extra addition was live music and a good band indeed! We will be back for sure. Food variety was rather limited. Western food quality, especially the cold dishes is subpar. Local food fared slightly better. There is a band that goes around playing. It was quite nice and created a good atmosphere. The customer service was ok. Decided to come here to celebrate husband’s birthday after came here for Mother’s Day dinner in May. Price per pax is quite reasonable for a hotel like Concorde. Food was also quite good, choices & variety of food, overall it was a good and nice experience having to dined here. Staff were friendly with live band going from table to table performing songs and music. Came here for the meal as part of our KL excursion through our cruise. Food is pretty good, but the variety for our mains was a bit lacking. Desserts were tasty. Not bad but not worth a special trip or great expense. Excellent sea food buffet month (during March 2019) in Melting pot cafe in Hotel Concorde in KL. Starting with the sea food live cooking to the tasty noodles and the sushi bar..I would say, super arrangement with very tasty food preparations. The ambiance of the restaurant is enhanced with the live music being performed. Finally, the dessert desk is the best part of the dinner including variety of fruits and sweets including ice cream. Malaysia Dish were always fabulous as I here and I for one had just ordered one from the menu and it was so delious. I recommend this while staying at Concorde Hotel. I was quite shock with the quality and varience of foods displayed for the buffet dinner.

Keep it up. There are many banana leaf restaurants in Bangsar, Kuala Lumpur, however there is one good and clean restaurant located in Lorong Ara Kiri 1, Lucky Garden called Bala's Banana Leaf Restaurant. In terms of food presentation and taste, there is no doubt at all that they are good. In terms of service, their staff are very efficient, friendly and they attend to their customers very quickly. In fact, if you are their regular customer, they know by heart what is your favourite orders. But if you have any concern on their billing, do clarify that with the cashier. The Manager of this restaurant, Mr Richard is also a very friendly person with good PR and he attends to the customers very well. As for the ambience, this is an open door restaurant located at the corner lot, hence it gives you a good view facing the garden and Bangsar Village 1 shopping mall. This restaurant is always crowded at all time, therefore be early if you intend to have your meals there. There are ample parking lots surrounding this area. Just love this place due to the friendliness and service by the owner and family members. Smiles all round makes the food just taste better( which already taste great ) Come n try i highly recommend this place but alas parking can be troublesome on working days thats the only setback. Clean/Delicious/Good service If u want to enjoy a fantastic biryani and a spicy masala dosai ,I wouldn't think twice.. Highly recommended.  Excellent food there, the rice was perfect, the choice of items just right and the condiments spot on. The service is always good and the price fair. On this fourth visit in 10 days we at last opted for the house speciality of food served on banana leaf. We could not leave Malaysia without enjoying this traditional meal that has meant so much over the years at weddings and celebrations. Bala’s is unlike other restaurants in that no bookings are possible but that is part of the charm. I notice a somewhat impatient visitor illogically gave s poor review even though he had not enjoyed the delights as he was wanting the upstairs opened!! There is no need. We have visited 4 times and waiting for a table was always short. And the atmosphere alone made the experience worthwhile. We visited with Indian friends who are locals and each and every occasion the service was really excellent. The Operations Manager Richard controlled a very large number of staff delivering excellent customer service. The food is absolutely delicious. In the last 4 weeks we have been in Vietnam, Cambodia and Malaysia enjoying many restaurants including 5* hotel restaurants yet it is Bala’s that we will remember. If you want atmosphere, service and cuisine come to Bala’s. Finally, do try Bala’s Famous Mango Lassi. The best I have tasted and bitterly regret just having one today.

341,Nasi Lemak Tanglin,08:00 AM - 12:00 AM,"Tang Lin Jalan Cenderasari, Kuala Lumpur 50480 Malaysia",None,None,None,"One of the best nasi lemak in kl.. word of advise better take away than hving here always full of people.. fried chicken sotong sambal paru sambal chicken begedil just awesomeee.  One of the longest established nasi lemak places in KL. Great to eat there or take-away. Be sure to come early as the que gets quite long. I went at 7am on a Saturday and there was already 10-15 people queuing. Many side dishes to choose from with your nasi lemak (refer to picture). I really enjoyed the softness and fragrance of the rice. Spot on! Reasonable price for the portion given. Sambal quite nice since they blend it together with anchovies but a bit pricey compared to normal nasi lemak. Recommended to go early because the ques quite long if you late a bit. While eating you can enjoy busking from a group there which is quite nice to bring your family has good chit chat on weekend morning. Everything good and delicious. The food complex is known as Medan Selera Tanglin. You will find many stalls here selling grilled seafood with rice dishes on ala carte basis. Not air-conditioned though. The yummy nasi lemak with variety of side dishes to choose from. Will have to be patience since you'll encounter a long que especially in the weekends. Nasi Lemak Tanglin is one of famous Nasi Lemak in KL. I went on the weekend, and it was a very queue. You need to know what to order, the service super fast event a lot of people. The seating area not so conducive but it is acceptable for mess market offering. The winner of the best nasi lemak in Food Wars Malaysia. The quality of the food is the same since the first time i had in when i was a kid. Go for the sambal sotong. One of my favourite for breakfast when I have a carving for nasi lemak. And my must have is the sambal sotong. I usually there by 730am. The rice is freshly cooked, warm and smells great. The sambal and sotong are just awesome. Great way to kick start the day with a nice teh tarik. I occasionally go there with my family. Always long queue and a lot of variety of food to add on with your nasi lemak. Food is ok but used to be better. We heard a lot about Nasi Lemak Tanglin from KL friends. Set in a food court amidst greenery and other stalls, this little stall efficiently served up plates and packets of Nasi lemak. The basic Nasi Lemak costs MYR2 and extras for sides. Choose from squid, chicken, beef, lungs, eggs etc. I had mine with the sambal sotong (squid), paru (lungs) and egg while my Husband opted for fried chicken, curry chicken, paru and egg. The portion of peanuts and anchovies could have been a bit more generous. Generally delicious and a great breakfast to start the day. Queue doesn't take too Long. Legendary Nasi Lemak in KL, I've been told. Convinient location nearby major attractions and offices. The ambient is very pleasing, like picnic in the park. Delicious Nasi Lemak, but i have tasted better in Kampung Baru and Shah Alam. I would prefer if they use banana leaves to serve to enhance the aroma. The sambal is not as spicy, suitable for those soft tongue. Add on Rendang and various condiments available for a fee. This place is quite well known among city folk for nasi lemak. When I feel like having nasi lemak on a Sunday morning, this is where I go to. They open by 7am (or a little later) and have enough choices to keep everyone happy. Parking is easy too. Nasi Lemak Tanglin is one of the best known Nasi Lemak stalls in Kuala Lumpur. No matter what time I go, there's always a queue of people in front of the stall. The stall started out decades ago under a huge tree opposite Tanglin Hospital, nearby the food court where they currently operate. What I love about this place, the nasi fluffy and aromatic, and sambal sweet and runny. I find it just right. I recommend their sambal sotong and sambal limpa, it’s an absolute must try. This restaurant has been operating in Botanical Gardens for many years and serve one of the best nasi lemak in town. I normally take my breakfast at this restaurant after my morning exercise in the Botanical Gardens. This place is always crowded, both during weekdays and weekends.

We had chicken & rice it was delicious and the price was crazy cheap. Loved it. Mandi rice and fresh juices .. my husband will be back anytime we are in KL . Great food . Great value and tasty.  Hands down our best meal so far. We love middle eastern food and this did not disappoint. The meals are priced very well for the portions we received, on top of the friendly service from Mahmoud. We ordered a mixed grill, lamb grill, humus, lamb arayas and a couple of lemon mint drinks, which was too much for us, really. All for about 50RM. Delicious! So glad we found this place - well worth the search!! For the 3 adults and 2 kids, the total bill was ard USD$15. Take a uber or grab there. the neighborhood is very safe looking. Best to leave the place once you are done with eating. I had tried various Middle Eastern restaurants among Klang Valley area, this is by far one of the best. The price is extremely affordable, service is fast. I would give it 9 stars rating if I could! this the first place come to my mind when to relax and taste the traditional savour. During the time I was in Kuala Lumpur, this has been the only place for my lunch and dinners. We found this place by accident a few years ago. From than on everytime, we come KL, my wife request to come over. The establishment offers all kind of grilled meat, but we like most their grilled chicken with mandi rice. Whole chicken plus enormous plate of rice will set you RM 26 lately. it comes with some sauces and soup. Had a dinner at Suria, Syrian restaurant near the hotel, we had a full BBQ chicken with chips, pickles and Syrian bread, also had a Humus, Arabic Salad and rice.

We stopped by this place as it was still bright with few people still dining. The food still plenty to choose from and we picked ayam pop, rendang, masak lemak pucuk ubi, gulai urat and terung. Sambal hijau & merah. Tasty especially ayam pop & urat. Price was RM155 for 5 pax. Satisfied. This is my go-to place for padang food on weekends with my family. Week days, parking is a nightmare in the area. It is located down the road from the Australian Embassy, beside a nasi kandar restaurant just a stone's throw away from KLCC. It was a house which was converted into this restaurant. The atmosphere is pleasant with indoor and outdoor dining. The choices of dishes is a plenty. All of the padang favourites is delicious here. I think the food is one of the best around KL. You should try the rendang or ayam pop or the dendeng. I also notice that the Indonesian community also frequent this place a lot. I highly recommend this place for padang food. Food and service was great! Everything was delicious. Take note that they start cooking at around 10ish am so do not come before that. I've been here for a cupple of time already but only now I thinking of sharing it with others...... I would recomment people to this place if it is still early. About 11.30 to go eat as this place will be full at noon with a lit of office workers. There are a few dishes that I will order but I always look for the 'Daging Denden' the mouth watering slide beef will make one continueess impression that it is a good nasi padang cook. Then the beef berlado also another dish that will never missed from the table. In fact, this restaurant was recommended by my friend which was not Indonesian. Hmm..supa amazing....the first bite taste was ""brings my feeling"" to the city ""Bukit Tinggi"" in West Sumatera - Indonesia where this food originally came from. Rendang, Gulai Kalio, Meat Soup, Ayam Pop, Gulai Pucuk Ubi, and red/green sambal were genuine...its also located near to city center. Its then become my daily/ weekly visit.:) I love this restaurant because they don't try to adjust their seasonings to the local taste. Everything is authentic that they even have the gulai otak (brain curry) which many locals will find it too much. The prices are more reasonable than their competitors and the service is good. The only complaint is the lack of parking space.",4,19,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

The pastry is not as crispy and the filling which was filled with potatoes, chicken and egg is certainly not as rich as before. The coffee is still good, the only saving grace. Another grouse is the long wait for the food to be served. Expect to wait for at least half an hour.... minimum! Located within Ampang Tesco. We had chicken chop which we thought was pricey for the size of the chop. Brown sauce chicken chop at RM20 while regular chicken chop at RM16.85. Kopi is at RM4.35. Food tasted OK. Ambiance also OK but can get noisy as it is located in a shopping mall. Service was OK only even though they were quite responsive. Being foreign workers sometimes difficult to understand their response to your query. Good malaysian food for our first day in Kuala Lumpur. No too spicy and really good taste, price not too expensive. Have the famous Nasi Lemak and Roti chanai. Nice location at the Quill City Mall, good, cool ambiance & central location. Good food , service & friendly staff. Actually we wanted to have our grandson,s birthday party here. However, the place quite small for a large crows. So we chose the ""Happi Kiddo Cafe"" opposite this restaurant. My wife & I had the chicken chop & coffee. It's worth the price. It was the auspicious ocassion our daughter Lucia Ann & SIL Ramesh first born Rafeal's 1st Birthday.

This dimsum restaurant have many good type of item to choose. Excellent on the halal dimsum. The staff is polite and helpful & friendly quick in sedvicing with the guest. We enjoyed the lunch, thank for Mr Eric give special price to us & complimenrty the double boiled dessert to us. Keep up with the good work. We definitely will come back again. Prices for the Halal Dimsum buffet has gone up since it started a few years ago..oricey but one of the nicest freshly made dimsum palces around.. we have an excellent evening at China Treasure, SDCC. A big Thank You to Mr Eric and his team... attentive, customer oriented, very helpful and take time to explain. Good ambient, excellent selections, there are always something for everyone. Quality and fresh ingredients. Real value for money. Highly recommended and will come again. It has been a while that I've not eaten at this place as I've been posted at Ipoh since Chinese New Year. We ordered on a buffet concept as my family were hungry hahaha. I must say that their Dim Sum are much better than my last visit. Dumplings are much juicier, especially on the Siew Mai. Oops.. Over ordered, we couldn't finish the 25 servings of food, even with 4 persons. Must be the size of the dumplings are bigger than we used to have. Seek for the bill and we were charged for food wastage at RM5++ per piece. What to do, sigh. Pay an additional of RM30++ for it. As Malaysians, we tend to over order and cause wastages. No wonder every now and then we are always been critisize for wasting food, especially during the festive period. One of my daughters also complaining about the food wastage occurred ""Mummy mummy, you didn't read the newspaper the other day meh? Pile of food wastage picture on the first page!"" Very shylah, apologizing to her. Next time we order lesser. Not enough only addon. Lesson learnt at my 40s from my daughter, hahahaha. We had dim sums and roast duck. The dim sums were average. The roast duck was the attraction for us. Service was reasonable. There were ample parking spaces. This was our third visit and the place was not bad at all. A good halal restaurant that serve authentic Chinese new year dishes. Comfortable dining space and enjoyable experience. Yee sang is a must to usher the year ahead. With big portion, normally 2 plates already make you full. Their Chrysantimum Tea the best! Quite secluded area so privacy wise, it is good. This is one of the few Chinese restaurants with Jakim certification (different from ""pork free"" outlets). Went there with a friend of mine for the ala-minute buffet dinner. Service was prompt and courteous and the restaurant setting was very pleasant. It can get crowded during meal times but when we went, we were served almost immediately despite being a full house. Food was delicious and portions were huge (for 2) so be careful of what and how much you order. Drinks are not inclusive but all diners may take advantage of the dessert counter which features local chinese desserts and a cool refreshing ""cool me down"" sort of drink. The only negative thing about this restaurant is that you are only allowed to order till around 830 pm (for buffet dinner). All in all, this place is really good and am looking forward to dining here again soon with many more friends and family members.",3,82,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Very nice place for chat with friend, next to a small forest in the middle of the city. Very comfortable and relaxing. Great hospitality and very friendly people. Aween and Citi really knew how to look after us in the lobby lounge. Thank you. Had a short time chats with colleagues before going out for dinner. The place is so cozy. The service is the best. They also had a live music performance here. The ambiance at the lobby lounge is perfect for small talks and hanging out with friends. They offer food selection that is very much affordable. The seats are very comfortable and the lighting is just perfect. if you just want to chill, the lobby lounge is a great place. The customer service is excellent. A little distracting in the day time as there was a lot of foot traffic. Guess, it was because of the Easter weekend programs. Arch Quartet's musical instruments performance was good and soothing. Services was good and staff is friendly. Good place of relaxation for family. After such long, frustrating and tiring weeks, this is exactly what I need. A nice afternoon tea with accompany of lovely live string music! Too bad this only be available until end of April. However it does not stop me from coming back for a relaxing hideaway.

He told me about this place which was real close to Dorsett Hotel where I was staying. Chicken murtabak 6rm and a cold drink 3rm. So cheap and it tasted great. It's open 24 hours. It's an open kind of eatery, but you can sit under fans. This is mainly a ""rice restaurant"" serving ""Nasi Campur,"" or what in Holland, and I guess in Indonesia is called ""Nasi Rames."" It is a self-service place, where you get a pile of rice in the middle of a plate, and then walk along the food line selecting whatever you want: various fish, chicken, mutton, and vegetable offerings. You go to your table, a waiter looks at what you have, and writes a price on a ""post-it"" and sticks it to your tabletop, After you finish, you take collection of ""post-its"" to the cashier. One of my favorite restaurant in KL. Simply a comfort food. This is the place to enjoy true Malaysian Indian dishes. Taste authentic in such prime location. The shop is hidden away from the busy main street of KL central, located just across the Pavillion mall and behind the Renaissance Marriott Hotel. From breakfast to lunch, dinner and even supper... rice dishes to bread what ever you eat is fresh and satisfying. I would recommend this place to any local or tourist. We discovered SB Corner, a great coffee/breakfast cafe, in KL when we asked our concierge at the ParkRoyal hotel where he would eat breakfast if he forgot to eat at home. This cafe (or, mama shop as its referred to by locals) is a short walk from the ParkRoyal hotel. Its on the corner of Jalan Barat and Lorong Walter Granier streets, across the street from the Jalan Imbi Chapel. Here you will be dining in an open-air cafe where most of the patrons are local - stopping in before heading to work. The food is great, the waitstaff are friendly and most speak some broken English. The menus have pictures so if your waiter doesn't speak English well, you can simply point. The food is delish! It's a combination of Malay and Indian and prices are incredibly low. My husband and I each had a coffee, a full breakfast (2 Egg Dosa with chutneys and sambar, and a side of Vada) and we only spent about 9-10 Ringgits total (2.50 USD). I highly suggest you stop in here if you're staying around this area. (Worth mentioning: they are open 24 hours!)I almost have my breakfast with my wife . We have breakfast some time tosai,roti canai,or rava tosai .we enjoyed the best breakfast is the rava tosai.i can give them 5 * .even we went to many Indian restaurant at kl or at little India at big restaurants like 5* even.we never have the best test like at sb coner.

This place serves a great variety of authentic Pakistani food and also has a buffet option if you fancy sampling multiple items. They serve halwa puri every morning between 7-9:30am too. The service is a little relaxed (room for improvement) and the overall restaurant is of a reasonable standard compared to other casual dining options in local areas within KL, i.e. tables and chairs are not plastic and the restaurant has a fairly large capacity. After being served Malay food for continuously for 2 days, our group was craving Pakistani food. Someone recommended Chow Kit is the place, as soon as we got off from our van we saw Mehran and just went inside. We were 11 ppl altogether. The waiter made us sit immediately, we were told that we will pay individually as per our order; he guided us continuously. It was a buffet set up. The rush was minimal, food quality was absolutely amazing and it satisfied our craving. The waiter did a amazing job, was thorough and attentive throughout our stay. The cleanliness was an issue, bathroom and hand wash area stank typically maybe because i saw infants on the backside of hotel playing. Probably a family set-up, so i am willing to ignore this part as the tables, glasses and cutlery were clean. Even the fresh juices served were fantastic! Good Indian food with lot of variety. Indian , pakistani test is available . Tandoor items are very good . Hotel is clean and hygenic. Even at 2pm this place was pretty crowded but I had no trouble finding a table. Within a minute of sitting down, someone took my order and my food was delivered about 8 minutes later. The serving of mutton curry was small but very good - the naan, though, was excellent, having just come out of the traditional oven. Staff was friendly enough. No alcohol sold. The meheran restaurant is the best choice for me. This place, i frequently drop there for tasty Indian food .. They open 7 days in a week and 24 hrs in a days. My best timing to visit there is around 1 pm, for lunch .they have large buffet station including salad and desserts.which are fresh and hot..i like this place very much... They serve good food in reasonable prices. The services is also good there..which make me visit again and again .. Whenever I am in KL,I do not eat anywhere else but only here.This is THE place for tasty ""tandoori Roti"" (not chapati ;a misnomer in Malaysia), tasty Naan and a full range of Pakistani dishes.From Steam chicken to Palak Aaloo,you just name it! It is here.I still have to try all the dishes one by one as there is so much choice of delicious food here. This is an authentic Pakistani food restaurant in KL.For those who are sick of tasteless ubiquitous Nasi Kandar food and monotonous Malay foods, this place is a heaven! The staff are well behaved,courteous,smiling faced,efficient and very helpful.This comes as a pleasant surprise in Malaysia as at every other local Nasi Kandar or Malay restaurants,the staff is not bothered to welcome or please a customer. They behave as if they are the boss ,not the customer. They seem to be disinterested in their job,when you order they serve you with a scorn on their faces.Usually they will not come & attend you unless you call them....even when the waiter sees you sitting on the table,he will just walk away instead of attending you!! Visited this restaurant more than 3times during my trip 2 KL...The thing that surprised me was that we can select the quantity we need..seeing this kind of restaurant for the first time, and the bill us according to that ..the whole restaurant is a free smoking zone where people have their tea or food and smoke ..being a foodie i feel for their taste..superb nan and chicken dishes..epically their tikka and all...Very friendly staff and they don't mind in explaining us about the dishes ,,If by any chance i go again to KL will have ma food only from MEHRAN..cheers guys ....i give you a 10/10.",3.5,16,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Great Dinner at Shang Palace this evening. the ingredients were fresh and service impeccable. We were totally pampered and the food was delightful. A special thanks to Yvone and her team. Lee Ah Loy, Andy Hew and Monica. Did not have high expectations when trying another Chinese restaurant in a five star hotel. The first impression upon entering the premises was clean and cordially welcome. Service provided by the staff was efficient and polite. Selected a few choices which included the barbeque platter, garlic steam prawns, spicy lady fingers, and a soup. Cooking came out well balanced, tasty and appetising suitable for everyone. Let's start with this place's ambiance. The restaurant is beautiful!! I love the red entrance and decor. We were staying at Shangri-La KL and had lunch here. The service was really nice and the food was delicious, very big portions, we were truly satisfied. I highly recommend the Shang Palace! We had a lovely lunch here during our visit at the Shangri-La KL. Chinese cuisine is not something we typically eat but we thought we should roll the dice and give the restaurant a try since it looked so good. We were very happy we did because it was a fantastic experience. The food was extremely tasty and the portions were big. We were able to share 3 dishes that was more than enough for two people. Amazing tea selection as well. Even if you don't like Chinese food this is well worth a try. I think you will be pleasantly surprised! The restaurant is not serving pork but the food still maintain a very good standard. Great dim sum. one of the best in KL. Booking recommended. A friend and colleague who had recently repatriated to Malaysia took me here for dinner when I was there on a business trip. She has many fond memories of going here for special occasions with her family when she was growing up. She ordered Peking Duck for us to split which was served table side with the staff slicing the skin off the duck and then another person putting the skin, sauce, and vegetables into the pancakes and then folding/rolling them. OMG, so good. We both ate a bunch. The rest of the duck meat was cooked with dry noodles. We had way more than we could eat, so my friend took home the leftovers. We also had the Lotus Pancake for dessert. Everything was delicious. Very nice ambience. With 4 alcoholic drinks and 1 softdrink, our total was RM 370 after tax and service charge. This is a bit higher than my other meals in KL, but this was for Peking Duck and it was excellent. Highly recommend! Shang palace is in Shangri-La hotel and wow I felt like we were in a bond film, stylish opulence, really lovely. The food was delicious and not overpriced.

Love the area where there is plenty of sunlight with fresh plants. Their chili sauce is hot and spicy, also order the pho. Service is ok but i do think one of the wait staff has a very strong body odor which is definitely something that the management must look into. This venue used to be a coffee joint. We trooped in and ordered different dishes: grilled turmeric chicken banh mi, sliced chicken noodle, sliced beef noodle,bun cha fried turmeric fish and dill, chicken and tiger prawn rice paper rolls, Drinks were iced vietnamese royal milk tea, icced vietnamese royal black tea and iced honey lemon. Sampled the rice paper rolls first: scrumptious chicken and prawn wrapped in transparent paper rolls that are dipped in a piquant sauce. My order of turmeric fish and dill was delectable: thin noodles mixed with vege and a sprinkle of groundnuts which is bathed with a sweet sauce. My family their dishes and the beef noodles had the best tasting soup. The meat is supplied by a halal supplier, so we ate with relish without fear. This was my second visit to a Super Saigon restaurant and my first for dinner. As usual the place has a very bright, modern feel to it. Love the decor on your walls and your illustrated menus for ease of choosing a dish. Not many Malaysians can claim familiarity with Vietnamese food so I think it helps to be able to see the item on the menu first. Service was quick and generally polite by the foreign staff. Ordered the Australian beef pho (all their beef is Australian beef apparantly- the reason they claim their Melbourne links, according to the waiter), and a salad consisting of grilled chicken and crunchy fried spring rolls. We also ordered the fresh prawn spring rolls. The food was delicious and as with most Asians I was very happy to have such great condiments on the table. The sambal in particular is to die for and is also offered for sale to take away if you would like. I especially loved the fact that your salad sides that go with the main are bottomless (very Vietnamese) so you can keep topping up your bee sprouts, herbs and Birdseye chill is multiple times. The waiters should be a bit more alert and ready to topup on request- maybe they aren't used to having such avid salad lovers such as myself visit. As for the fresh spring rolls, if it could just be a bit juicier (if I make them I usual spoon in some sauce already in the spring roll) it would be perfect. Found them just a little bit dry but that’s just my personal taste. Love lots of sauce on everything so their generous side dish of sweet Thai chilli dipping sauce was also great. If you are into cheese you should try and will hopefully love the cheesecake soft serve ice creams that are sold here. They are very cheesy flavoured and creamy. I could easily eat 2 after any of their mains and a starter. Still on my list to try on my next visit are the ‘ban mi’ options on the menu and the ‘flan’ dessert which is essentially a crepe caramel but with coconut milk/cream instead of dairy cream. If I’m already planning my next visit it is def a good sign. Worth a visit esp for a quick meal or a healthier lighter option (minus the cheesecake soft serve that is)! love it delicious great service - friendly staff love the avocado drink love the saigon soup affordable price.",4,15,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Can’t rave enough about the food. Best Briyani in town. Other favourites are the kebabs, quasedillas, carbonara and pomelo salad, and the desserts are to die for ! Nice for a small family gathering and team lunch! a small cafe so maybe you need to make a reservation first. This has to be my current favourite restaurant. The overall ambience was pleasant, nice & clean. Dining here feels like home, with exclusive feel to it. Price wise was okay, not that expensive though. Many Dato’ & Datins came here. But staff were lovely enough & treats everyone the same. I must enhance the staffs are really friendly, polite and looks passionate in doing their job. Kudos to the team. Food recommendations; Agli Olio with Calamari, Biryani, and rocket salad. Their portions are huge, all tastes amazing. I love coming here! Caramel coffee is nice too! A must order. Very nice mutton briyani - super tender mutton. Rice a bit “wet” but not too bad. Large portion, can share for small eaters. Place is a bit small, not an ideal place to chill. Did not try anything else though. Would not have noticed this place had someone not told me about it. Was sceptical but boy was I wrong. We shared the pomelo salad and the keema ground beef dish. Both were excellent. Service was also great. I would definitely come again if in this area. Tucked just beside the escalator .. one might just walk past without a 2nd glance .. shd gv it a try .. serves good food .. local m'sian fare .. curry mee .. mee rebus .. olio olio spaghetti .. briyani .. & more .. try their house specialty lemon cake & pavlova .. no regrets .. Delicious mutton briyani, a must try👍 Wonderful and warm staff too. Some cakes are ok too. Trying it again with my son and food is consistent. Oh yes I’ve tried the ginger tea on another occasion and that is nice too. This restaurant was chosen by our friends who eat here regularly but it was our first time. There is quite a large menu with local dishes and European food. Service was friendly, food was tasty, portions were quite large and the price pretty reasonable. Our cappuccino came with a picture of a cat in the foam which was cute. We sat outside the restaurant but inside the shopping mall on comfy chairs. I would come back. The restaurant is at the back of the new part of Bangsar Shopping Centre. We ordered nasi lemak and mee goreng. Both were tasty but the sambal had a slightly unusual spice (?Indian) which is not typical. Sambal, being the main condiment that makes or breaks nasi lemak, is slightly off the mark in my opinion, hence 4*. Family restaurant that serves local, western and Indian food. The restaurant is cosy and clean. Food is delicious. My all-time favorite is the Chicken Briyani Rice. Can’t get bored with it. Portion is huge for ladies, just nice to share with another. Mee Rebus is most tasteful. The menu has just about every cuisine to serve a whole family.",4,15,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

I tried the classic nasi lemak with chicken curry and it was average. Nothing memorable for a dish over RM 10. Didn't have the kuih so cannot comment. Service was ok when I went. This is a place to go to for Malay kueh and food. The food here taste authentic and is reasonably priced. Service however needs to be improved. Nice nasi lemak and traditional Malay cakes. Long que and small space. Bit warm. Price is reasonable. Must come around 7 am for nasi lemak. Their roti jala is soft and fluffy and the chicken curry is delicious! They also serve a great variety of other Malaysian kueh and traditional dishes. Prices are reasonable. The only drawback is the small size of the cafe. from the smallish outlet in KL Sentral (now known as La Cucur Express), La Cucur now has a full restaurant at nearby Nu Sentral which is located at the lowest ground floor. La is spanish, and cucur is malay for delicacies or savories. So La Cucur means the savoury place where one finds typical malay fare such as laksa kedah, nasi campur, kueh mueh (this means an assortment of kueh or malay cakes). Cakes dont really tell what kueh means as it spans sweet stuff such as bingka (or bengkang in northern patois) and pulut sekaya (northern for seri muka, a cake made of glutinous rice with a green sweet topping made from pandan leaves) to spicy food such as laksa utara and mee rebus. i ordered laksa utara (northern version of noodles in fish gravy) set which comes with a free bingka and kopi O. Being a northerner, the laksa was not as good as the ones found in my home state but it was ok. Not too filling and just nice for one eager to start a proper diet, after an admonition by his doctor....alas giving up the joy of eating. This is a cafe style setting in an upscale shopping mall serving traditional Malay delicacies. As this cafe is fully air-conditioned, you can basically enjoy these delicacies in a very comfortable environment. The taste of the food is familiar, nothing fantastic but expect to pay a little bit more for the environment rendered. It's good enough for a quick meal of nasi lemak or some basic local fare. Not bad, not great either. Plenty of locals. I guess it's down to attractive pricing. La Cucur is a revelation. One will never imagine a malay kueh (delicacy) will cost more than rm1 but La Cucur dared to price it as such, and there is always a crowd. Why? because many will reason out that a piece of pastry at Starbucks will set them back a few ringgit, so why stint on malay 'pastry'? which taste even better? especially with teh tarik, the frothy Malaysian milk tea. La Cucur serves rice and noodles, but my favorite when i visit is laksa utara, vermicelli dunked in hot fish gravy that is awesome to the taste. marry it with teh tarik and a kueh, in my case one that has ubi kayu or cassava. another hit is the pineapple-tinged kueh that is pleasant to the palate. So this place has Soto, noodles, nasi lemak and kue. The noodles are about rm 12. The cafe inside seems hot but it's better than some I have been to. They clear the tables so quick so even though it seems to rush, things are still ok and it's possible to find a table. Relatively happy especially since breakfast in hotel is so expensive in comparison.",3,27,Cafe,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Lots of flavour and big servings. The place was full when we were there. Groups of friends and families. Staff were friendly and helpful. Would definitely return. Can’t see why people are complaining. We decided to order an assortment for tea time.The food came hot,freshly cooked and tasty!The samosas and popiahs were really delicious with the sauce.Loved the Syrup Bandung Selasih...not too sweet.Prices are reasonable and affordable.Will definitely come back for tea-time again! I went there for lunch with a group of friends and was very impressed by the quality of the food, we all eat different meals and they were all good. It was busy and yet the service was good and I liked the outdoor feel to it despite the fact it is part of a very big mall. This is a nice area to go to and apparently it has an even better feel in the evening. A must for Malay food lovers when in Bangsar area of Kuala Lumpur. Had ABC and goreng pisang (banana fritters). Both for a nice price of RM10.50. Not bad for KL! Very traditional, local meals. Adequate size portions with fresh ingredients and well presented. The menu is easy to read. The service initially very prompt however once served it is hard to get the attention of the staff. If you are looking for local food served in a Hygenic pleasant location this is the place for you. Frequented by locals so you know the food is good. I would return if in the local area. Malaysians are very particular with their food and there are so many good food places everywhere. As an Asian tourist, i think this place is very good. Road-side, nicely renovated, no air con, there are 10 kinds of coffee to choose from and so many different variations of rice dishes. It's great for me. Went for lunch with office colleagues. The day specials look like normal Malay dishes. Tried the Lamb Biriyani and it was very good. The Restoran is very open with ceiling fans. Wished it had non smoking sections.. Dropping by to have my favourite nasi kerabu almost every afternoon. Big portion, great taste, nice and strategic place. If you want to dine in here, better be early or else you will have to wait in line. Always packed during peak hour. We have eaten at different locations at Bangsar. Recently, we decided to try Chawan, as we immersed ourselves into the Malaysian cuisine. The atmosphere is relaxing, place impeccable. Our meal consisted of 4 pieces of samosa, 2 chicken and 2 of beef with Teh Tarik for me and Honey lemon tea for my gf. Then our course meal, Nasi putih daging salai masak lemak cili api and puluk kuning for each . The entire meal was amazing charged at only RM52. You gotta love local Malaysian cuisine. Especially the stuff you find at the corner eateries. What do you get when you put together great upcycled local Malaysian favourite a and a trendy industrial interior? Chawan! I love this place. The decor is raw, simple and inspired. But maybe still not as inspired as the menu. You'll find lots of safe options and the staff will tell you what's great. Try the nasi Ayam tomato berempa. OMG the skin of the chicken leg is so perfectly crispy and spiced and it all goes so perfectly with the local pickles and nasi (rice).",3,75,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

If you like Dim Sum but don't take pork, here is a great place to get the Siew Mai, Knorr Mai Kai etc. Was recommended this restaurant by a friend and I am glad that I decided to go. The restaurant can be crowded with tour groups during lunch so prior reservation is advisable. As menus are available on the website you can also pre-book your chosen menu and it will be served accordingly. The arrangement of the table is way too close to each other with a minimal elbow space but the good food made up for it. The manager Eric was as attentive as his team. Will definitely come back again. 26 of us had our Chinese New Year lunch here and they were so helpful to seat us in 2 tables. It was spacious and they prepared special fried rice for one of our colleague who is vegetarian. The food was delicious - we opted for the set lunch, although some of us were shocked at the pricey tea, rice, towels, tidbits which were not included in the set lunch price. The main draw for us was the price but we were pleasantly surprised by the attentive staff and the excellent food! Something so simple like Seafood fried rice was beyond expectation. Unfortunately, you will not be able to choose the fried dim sums at night as its only available during the day.",4,24,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,
356,Aji Don,9.00 AM - 9.40 PM,"Plaza Damas, Kuala Lumpur Malaysia",None,None,None,"Never disappointed eating here, quick and tasty Malaysian dishes.Fast service. Price Cheap and reasonable. i've lunch & dine here at least twice a month...quite crowded during lunch hour...variety of local food to choose such as soto, mi goreng, nasi ayam, tauhu bakar, satay and others...most of the food were quite good & tasty...reasonable price...fast service...recommended... There are numerous stalls in this warong. I ordered Char Kuey Teow after being told that it's good by a friend. Yes indeed it's good. Superb and delicious. If I wasn't bother about weight gaining I can have 2 servings. For the people who craving for hawkers style quality food please do come here. Price wise is affordable. Great tasty food there!! Really love the Penang Fried Kuey Tiaw!! A must food that u need to have. Seriously. If your family is big, then here is the place where everyone can enjoy their food of choice at good value of money. From Malaysian to western foods. The table is large enough to cater for twelve person at a time. The drinks are served in less than five minutes after you place an order. For those with kids, order the Lychee Iced Tea. They are going to love it. Pay on the spot for the drinks, it's easier. I always came here for the ""Mee Rebus Tulang"", ""Nasi Ayam"" and ""popiah"". If you have trouble ordering, the staff will help you. It's easy to find, located between MyNews, Mari Canai and Starbucks. The downside of Aji Adon is that this is not a cigarette-free place. their afternoon teh tarik time is lovely, with the lovely teh tariks - not to sweet and nice fresh hot fried pisang goreng which is lovely. nice and simple, delicious. Great stall food in Sri Hartamas located at the top end and outside of Sri Hartamas Shopping Centre just opposite Starbucks. Great Satay! Probaby the best in KL, Good Chicken Rice, Fried Rice, Mee Rebus, Tauhu Bakar, Soto Ayam. The Kuay Teow is passable and there is even some western foods ala lamb chop but nothing to shout about. Reasonable stall prices and the staff are really friendly. Its a real neighbourhood eatery where everyone seems to know someone! Great Place for a quick meal or even to take overseas visitors who want local food. Among the many food outlets in plaza damas, i like this the best. The mee rebus tulang is a well known speciality here. However, it is only available on fridays and saturdays. We were fortunate enough to come on a friday. The atmosphere is lovely as the crowd was good and cool after the rain. Another good dish here is the soto ayam. However, i didn't manage to order it this time around. My wife ordered the nasi goreng and satay here. The nasi goreng was decent but the satay was pretty alright. The satay gravy had the sambal goreng mix and this is the kind of gravy i enjoy. Dig this place and will definitely come again and recommend to others.",4,20,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Aji Don.jpg,,

To date, still still as one of our comfort foods which we go to on a bad day to turn our frown upside down knowing for certain we would not be disappointed.Service: We placed the order via a third party app which was pretty straight forward.Packaging: Ordinary take away boxes.Fried Chicken Wings (RM 11.29) Although fried chicken has the most potential to go wrong in the take away box due to the evils of condensation, this restaurant has managed to deliver the wings in an addictive finger-licking manner. They were covered in batter and deep fried to a crispy golden brown yet delightfully juicy within. Recommended? You have been forewarned, it is ridiculously addictive. Spicy Szechuan Dumplings (RM 12.72) The dumplings were firm to the touch yet wrapped with a soft and chewy skin. Sitting within a pool of light soy sauce with a touch of fresh cut chillies and refreshing chives giving the dish a spicy edge. Recommended? These bite sized delights are sure to satisfy one’s craving. Panfried Radish Cake - RM 9.96. The Radish Cakes were slightly charred on the edges and soft and slightly fluffy within with a very smooth texture. Recommended? The charred edges were to the delight of our peckish monk3y. Although we have ordered from them time and again, some restaurants never fail get old especially with our carvings strike. A lovely setting and ambiance as you enter the shop. The dimsum were served hot and fresh. Do try out a few dishes to get the variant of delicacies served here. This is one of my favorite dim sum place. It has good dim sum with decent price. My favorite here is that egg bun and also spicy szechuan dumplings. Recommended!!! Congee served not piping hot, just warm. Other dishes was hot though. Food tastes great, fresh ingredients. Place was full but waiting time is acceptable. Around 20 minutes. Staff not too friendly. No smile at all, Robotic. For Halal Dim Sum, “Dim Sum Place” in Singapore is still the best. We tried this place randomly and returned to it for 3 more times in a week. The food was consistently amazing, great service and value for money. All the dim sums we tried were fresh and delicious. We had a fairly great dim sum here at Dolly. We ordered not very much items for 6 person. The service here was good.",4,92,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

But, when i sat down, i realized it's a Thai restaurant. I love the deco of the restaurant. I ordered Steamed Siakap Rice set. The soup was just perfect in taste. It has the taste of sour, sweet and spicy. And, not to forget their Kai Ping with sticky rice. I like the taste of the chicken (grilled). Surprisingly, it goes well with the sticky rice. And the Thai Iced Tea. So delicious. Not too sweet. The price is affordable too. We had lunch here a few times while. The servers here are just wonderful and delicious food, especially tom yam soup. Must try! There is much to love about Tigerlily Thai Restaurant, all it’s good foods and drinks. A balancing act of strong Thai flavours - primarily sour, spicy, salty, and sweet - herbs and spices have successfully created the complex, well-balanced inimitable taste of Thai food. Getting to experience the authentic Thai cuisine and the ambience practically have me digging for a needle in a haystack! The burst of flavourful Thai cuisine have satisfied my taste bud to the max. Not to forget, rounded up my Thai adventure with Tigerlily’s signature Mango Sticky Rice is a must! Nice ambience with wide range of Thai dish choices. The portion was just right. Worth try of authentic Thai food. Visited the outlet with my family. The staff is friendly and helpful. Really like the food here and will I bring my friends to this restaurant again. A good place for family and friends gathering. This year Tigerlily offer Chinese New Year Yee Sang which is also Halal. Very unique. Using fresh ingredients like Papaya, cucumber, carrot, Mango and also Pineapple. Ong Lai Ong Lai. Not too sweet and definitely must try this year. Keep up the creativeness. Hope to see and able to try more new and special dish here. This is my favorite Thai Restaurant in Kuala Lumpur. Already went to DC Mall and also Melawati Mall. Both restaurant foods very nice and delicious. Their service also very very very friendly. Price also reasonable.... Last 2 weeks I came, to Tiger Lily DC Mall with my friends n having my favourite Basil Chicken Claypot ,Green Curry Chicken n my Fav drink Pandan Kasturi.. This is my first visit to the restaurant, tasty food and ambience is just awesome. We had the Thai Basil Minced Chicken, BBQ sotong (squid), steam Siakap with lemongrass sauce (aka steam Fish with lime sauce). Will definitely come back! The restaurant located at Damansara City Mall...nice embrace, cosy place for dining! Highlight of the menu: Kai Ping with Sticky Rice.....thumbs up for this dish👍👍 Barbeque Sotong😋 Mouth watering appetizer Mango salad... Came here with a bunch of friends... First time came here & make us feel exactly like we were at Thailand instead at Msia. The food were delicious and yummylicious. The spicyness of Tom Yam is awesome... Kai Ping with sticky rice is very special. Love it and the combination of the sticky rice with the chicken satay really blend in together as you put it in your mouth.

Definitely will come again ❤ Kampung Kitchen is situated in the area of KLCC it only take 8 mins to KLCC .It is suitable for family and friend to have dinner at here. The Lunch buffet was only for RM35! It is value for money. RM 35 for the weekday buffet lunch it's really great. The food is also delicious and the environment is beautiful. I highly recommend it for family or friends. My best recommendation is chicken pandan. Can't believe there's actually a buffet that's only RM35 in the middle of the city of Kuala Lumpur.

Low price & outdoor seated. Nasi Lemak Antarabangsa 😍 Even too many people but still the best. The place is iconic not only for local, the tourist should come here to taste it by yourself! 👍🏻 So much has change about this well known nasi lemak.used to be operated in big space across the road.anyway my last visit was 15years so this time around made a point to try.well the food is ok the variety is no more that it used to be like many.but it is still nice as it has chicken rendang or fried,daging rendang and fish.The jagung bakar across it is a must try. Came straight from the airport. Had a fabulous meal. Great price. Satisfied my craving after that pitiful nasi lemak on Air Asia X. Great place. Tried their standard nasi lemak that comes with fried chicken, hard-boiled egg and sambal. The rice was fragrant, fried chicken was tender and nicely seasoned. Really like the sambal which really compliments the dish well. Overall pretty happy with the meal. Since the founder passed the operations to her inlaws to manage, there were rumours saying that the quality has dropped. I am not sure whether its true or not, but it is still in my top list for nasi lemak in KL. The squid sambal makes a huge difference so dont forget to mix in your nasi lemak. Parking is not as bad as before, there are also paid parking lots. Not the best of the best nasi lemak , but its a really good nasi lemak you can find in this area. Worth a visit! It was good ambience to eat nasi lemak in the middle of Kampung Baru, a historic Malay village, with beautiful views of iconic Petronas Twin Towers. I waited half hour as the fried chicken ran out. The teh tarik was good, light and bubbly the way it should be. The waitress came to tell us as soon as the fried chicken was ready, very nice of her. The rice was fragrant, the best part was the sambal, and the freshly prepared fried chicken complemented a good supper. There was a dead cockroach on the ground but it did not bother me much. Plenty of friendly cats were around. I had to shoo one away which tried to eat with me. I go to this restaurant purely for the food and I do not expect any form of service or staff attentiveness in return. I believe some of you are deeply disappointed with the services rendered but if you put that concern aside, this food stall is still the best for me. Pricey Nasi Lemak but definitely good. One of the better ones in KL but don't expect service or cleanliness. You can always takeaway if you don't want to sit and eat (I've seen rats and roaches crawling around that area). Rice in between washed fork- had to rinse it again. Parking is absurd, unless you pay RM5 for it which is so overpriced too. What can I say I love my nasi lemak and they have been doing it bloody good for a long time .. I come here for a late nite fix...the chicken is always extra crispy...

This is a very large sprawling restaurant but visually interesting given that its based on traditional malay architecture. It is located next to the lake in the Taman Tasik Titiwangsa (Park). Indeed the restaurant has many water features of its own around which the various parts of the restaurant are located. It is indeed huge, there were three separate functions going in different parts when I visited, plus a large area for the normal ""walk-in"" clientele. The function I attended there was a traditional malay buffet spread, which was I must admit excellent. I will be the first to admit that buffets put on by large establishments are often disappointing, however this buffet was indeed very good with a large selection of well cooked and delicious food. The beef dish was wonderfully tender. The service was good and the place was also spotlessly clean. It most definitely had a nice relaxed aura to it. Although I can't vouch for the ""value for money"" aspect of the restaurant, as I was invited to a corporate buffet function, I would be surprised if it wasn't in the mid price range. Highly recommended for both corporate functions and the general public. We were invited here by some friends and enjoyed the evening so much. The food was delicious and the show kept the kids and adults entertained throughout. They have variety of local dishes...blackpepper lamb grill is very nice...the ambience is so relax so its just a great place for u to hang out with your friend or even family member... Previously known as ""Nelayan"", this restaurant is owned by D'Saji, a subsidiary of Felda. I came here with my family for breakfast which they served from 7:30am-10:30am daily. The restaurant incorporates a traditional Malay architecture in its design and the interior decos are equally lovely too. Many people do not realized about the existence of this restaurant because it is a bit hidden. I would highly recommend everyone who visit the Taman Tasik Titiwangsa to dine in here because this restaurant is located inside this park. Went their with my toddler who loved the cultural dances. The food was sufficient for us, even though I have read reviews of the buffet dinner and didn't feel that way. There are plenty of local options but the best was the steam boat and Johor Laksa. The variety was sufficient for its price. Toddlers under 4 years are free. The show starts around 8pm. I do not know of another such place in KL which offers cultural show daily. Had breakfast with family this morning at the D'saji restaurant. D'saji offers a simple buffet breakfast daily. The menu were Nasi Lemak, char kuey teow, bread, chicken curry, salad and coffee/tea at a very reasonable price. The char kuey teow tasted good. The foods were more than suffice for our breakfast. Great place for those who want to have a simple breakfast while enjoying the peaceful ambience. Earlier part of the day I attended a Wedding Invitation at the right wing (Dewan Anggerik) of the venue. Passing the counter near the main entrance I caught sight of a 'steamboat' ad. at the open cafe. Totally unplanned I made a reservation for 4. Mentioning to them my newly wedded son wil be attending. Bringing along a birthday cake for my new daughter inlaw. The birthday cake surprised them both, but I too was taken by surprise with an extra comfort D'Saji gave us. The 'steamboat' was good and the service prompt. Fatin (a staf) was very helpful and we're very impressed with the services rendered. The multi-sauces were up to our taste and it came with fresh prawns, vege. and others and we have nothing to complain. The drinks were good too. The multi-dance performed was an added colour and excitement to our visit. I had the same experience in Kg Nelayan Kota Kinabalu where the dances are locals, but the KL dances did their part well too.

We were early and did not have to wait for a table. The restaurant started filling up and there was a small queue for tables. The menu was quite extensive with a good range of dim sum. We were served almost immediately but had to wait awhile for the steamed dishes to arrive. The dim sums were tasty and freshly prepare. Service was also attentive and friendly.Pricing was reasonable with a discount for Sogo card members. I would not rate them as the best in town but they are good. Yes, it's still the best halal dim sum in town. Located at level 6 of Sogo Shopping Complex, it's a very nice place to dine. Food is very delicious, very crowded at lunch hour, best to make reservations in advance. Quite noisy environment but the delicious food compensated it. Price is reasonable. Gets discount if you are a SogoCard member. Will come again. We tried the crispy duck, excellent flavour, crispy skin, pink inside, but alittle oily. Dim sums are fresh too. Reasonably priced too. Good service even during hectic hour. Approximate rm20-40 per person, if you take the set meal about 10++. The dim sum taste very food , at least is not frozen one. You can find many authentic Chinese dishes here, chicken leg, clay pot fish belly and Xiao long pao(soup dumplings). Went for CNY lunch. Order the 6 pax set. The Yee Sang was delicious, after we had our Yee Sang gotta wait at least 30 minutes for the next course, which is the soup. We had to call the waitress/waiters many times yet no show of our next course. Very frustrating! An easy place to dine for lunch. Floors are tiled and does not have the very high end restaurant feel but a lot of officer workers do visit so it can get pretty noisy. They do have some credit card promo but the staff either are not well versed or they dont want you to get the discounts. I usually drop in this restaurant when I shop at Sogo. I've found the dim sum and Chinese pastries fresh and delicious. Without fail, I'll even pack them for my family, too for every visit. However, the prices have been increased and the portions reduced, as well. I'd rate the food a 4/5 but the atmosphere was a little stuffy, probably only a 3/5. Service was so-so, hence another 3/5. There were 3 of us and the table given was tiny. Lot of other ""reserved' tables, a no show to some I noticed. This is one nice Chinese restaurant that offers good and delicious food. Muslims can dine here because it's Halal. The Dim Sum is so delicious. The price is reasonable. The staff is friendly and well trained, polite. It's good to make reservations if you are coming for lunch, it could be very packed.

Definitely will bring the whole family to visit. I had a healthy energy booster juice combo to quench my thirst to pick me up after acupuncture session. The smoked salmon cream cheese bagel was just perfect with the cucumber zesty salad. I could resist having the gula melaka ice cream which made for the perfect ending to the meal. Totally satisfied. Service was excellent. No complaints. I just loved the place. It's nice, clean and the meals all delicious ,healthy and will make you full , you will leave the restaurant with a smile and satisfaction. Beautiful place to relax and have a drink. The desserts selections were amazing and everything was almost perfect! Been exactly 1year since I have last visited marmalade. Been patronising other cafe due to service and has been regular there due to consistency. Food and price are still same and good. My regular must oversee food are chicken teriyaki bowl @ RM32 nett. Healthy yummy food but price are slightly expensive. I’m glad service has improved from my previously visit and I’m really glad about it. Will definitely revisit again as service and attitude and attentiveness of server filling up water and etc has been improved. Came here for lunch with my two kids. The 4 year old saw the play area and immediately ran in to play. We ordered the smoked duck carbonara and crab meat gremalata. Both pastas were very well done. The carbonara was made with eggs-very authentic! My 4 year old enjoyed her fish fingers as well. The restaurants makes an effort to serve healthier options which is great. Nice food & kids friendly restaurant, it located at bangsar village II, we enjoy the food & our kids enjoy the play area. great good. and there is a small play area for kids. so perfect for parents with small kids. parents can enjoy the food while kids will be occupied. Main dishes ordered did taste fresh and flavourful. Food was served promptly. My gripe, staff does not repeat your orders. I just enquired about the sweet potato chips and the next thing I know it was served at my table. Contemplated returning it but my curiosity got the better of me.

Many thanks to the service team of Wai Ling, jojo and sangeetha for a wonderful dinner. This place has to be one of the best halal Chinese food restaurants in the klang Valley. Despite having to have stayed here twice this year. It was only on my second stay did I discover Celestial Court. A hidden gem. First impression when I walked in, was the beautiful space that relaxed you all immediately. In fact the corner tables near the windows are very instagrammable.And then came a gentleman, our waiter for the day, Mr Fazli. His jovial face and greetings makes us all feel (6 of us dine in) at ease despite the high end feel in the restaurant (you know what I mean when you are in atas place you sometimes feel out of place)...We were in for a treat. Mr Fazli offered us ala carte buffet at RM148 nett. Eat all we can, order as many and as happy as we can. We went for it and wasn't disappoint at all. The food was really nice. I am not exaggerating. I can't find fault in any of the dishes except for one squid which pale in comparison to those other shining dishes. We ordered for bamboo clam however they run out of it. Well, Mr Fazli then came to us with a special dish not in the menu to make up to our disappointment. Big thanks to all the chef in Celestial Court. You guys are really hidden treasure.As we chat up with our Waiter, Mr Fazli... It turns out this waiter that has been serving us the whole night (with lots of funny jokes) is actually Food & Beverage Manager of the Hotel. What a humble gentleman!Kudos to the management of the Hotel and special thanks to Mr Fazli whom take good care of our entire team throughout our stay and meals. Come here to try dim sum buffet with friends. Delicious food with reasonable price, of course, don’t compare with those at Jalan Ipoh or other place.... it’s a beautiful Chinese Restaurant in Sheraton Imperial KL hotel! If you think price is expensive, please go somewhere else. This restaurant doesn’t serve pork, but didn’t mention “Halal” or not. Please check with hotel if you want to know. However, food still taste good without pork as ingredient. Food portion just nice for 3 person sharing. Although no pork dishes are available, the selection of Dim Sum items is vast and all are delicious! After selecting our usual favorites we handed over the selection to our waitress who arranged a varied selection of delicacies.

Many locals inside so you can be sure that this is a good place. While exploring KLCC and shopping at Suria Mall, why not stop and taste some local delicacies at La Cucur. Amazingly authentic taste and affordable also. Located on the lower level, Ramlee Mall. La Cucur is the only surviving pioneer eatery in KLCC since KLCC opened in early 2000. From a quiant corner to a now quite comfy small eateries to sit around abt 40 people at one go. It serves authentic Malaysian traditional dishes esp. comfort food from nasi lemak with rendang to laksa johor and local delicacies like kuih lapis and kuih bakar and teh tarik (for non-Malaysian...you have to look it up for details of these delicacies). All the food are good and delicious and taste like the real ones. The price is a little bit more than the food outside sold by local vendors and I guessed its worth it. If you want to know and taste Malaysian food, this is the place to go to. Caution...during lunch hours, the place is packed wt office workers...so, either come early or after 2.00pm...the service can sometime be a little chaotic esp. during peak hours and if you are lucky, you will be served by a half-smiling server. In Suria KLCC, La Cucur is located at the Ramlee Wing on the Concourse level near the escalator. La Cucur has a great choice of local delicacies of Malaysian cuisine & more importantly, tasteful. Prices are moderate, but not cheap. Decor is basic, but clientele do not seem to care. Great food and choice. It has something that you can hardly find in other places. Its not the kind of place where you find everywhere is the same. Good service but the price is a little bit steep. Be ready to fork out for good food. The kuih provided is so tasty. You can find all kinds of Malay cuisine here. Please try their nasi lemak in the banana leaf or even their Laksa Johor. This small cafe sells a range of local kuihs and is popular during breakfast and tea time. We normally do a takeaway of the kuihs which are cheap and taste authentic. Service is fast but could be friendlier. If you want to try out small bytes of Malaysian snacks and drinks, that is the place to visit (in KLCC). prices are reasonable and service is quick.

At the time there were only a handful of shopping centres, Ampang Park was the equivalent of a KLCC or Pavilion now, followed by Weld and Jaya (owned by Cold Storage now part of Dairy Farm of HK) and Fitzpatrick. Ampang Park was the place to be seen, it had one of the first indoor arcades and that was my usual Saturday treat, fish and chips at Fitzpatrick after Mum went supermarketing and an afternoon in the arcade at Ampang Park. With the impending demolition of Ampang Park a little bit of history will disappear at the expense of progress (it’s to extend the LRT/underground station). Today is there last day of business for Cozy Corner in Ampang Park. Lots of history in this room, birthdays, anniversaries, first dates, awkward break ups, family lunches and dinners, hanging out at lunch with friends....too many to mention. As a tribute to this, we ordered many old, some colonial era, favourites like freshly fried battered prawn fritters, grilled seafood platter, sizzling steak, Hainanese chicken chop, sizzling lamb chop, Hainanese noodles, Kung Fu (Cantonese style with egg sauce) crispy noodles and oxtail soup all accompanied by the usual bread roll and butter. Five adults and two kids (both below 3 years old) polished off the lot. Food brought back many happy childhood memories and worth the indigestion from overeating that came soon after! The mock European decor hasn’t changed since the 1970s but this kitschy style has a certain sad charm. The service remains great, friendly and warm. Try the new location on Ampang Point, won’t be the same but hopefully will be just as good. I've kept on coming here since I was small for any special occasion with my family. I really love the ambiance of the restaurant and the servers' etiquette. It's always full during peak hour and season, it's better to make a reservation before you come. Salted Fish Fried Rice is one of my favorite food here. The quality and taste of food still maintain until now. Keep it up 😘 mee hailam and chicken chop are the only 2 menu's i've ever tasted at Cozy Corner.. not my cup of tea but it's my hubby's nostalgia food, so i just tag along...overall good, but the resto is screaming for refurbishment...i dont think they'll do it cause I heard even Ampang Park will soon be torn down.",3.5,82,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

The food was nice. My kids loved the nasi lemak. Special thanks to Rada and Elizabeth who were very hospitable. We had a great time. Merry Christmas! Decent spread to cater to everyone's needs. Service by team was excellent- attentive and friendly staff! Kids in particular enjoyed the fresh croissants served by Haziel. During my stay in Pullman KLCC Hotel & Residences, in the evening, I didn't miss the chance to try their dining experience of their ""Italian buffet"" in Eccucino Restaurant at Level 1 which only cost RM126 nett per adult for this November only, where I tried and enjoyed live stations of homemade gnocchi and cheesy prawn pizza! including seafood, western and local foods! Took a lot of photos of it! I really enjoyed my dining experience here! Highly recommended especially for those who love to eat Italian food and also enjoy seafood, western food and amazing desserts. Had dinner with family and friends here at Eccucino Pullman KLCC. The buffet spread is rather limited and not much variety to choose from. For the price of the buffet paid RM128 nett, one can get a much bigger spread elsewhere in Kuala Lumpur like at The Link, Pullman Bangsar. Though the variety of foods are limited, normal and common but the quality are commendable and foods are nice. My wife enjoyed the desserts very much. The environment is pretty good and spacious. The staffs are also efficient and friendly. Keep it up!! The down point is the car-park, spiral type and have to turn and turn right up to 5th floor however, the parking fee is reasonable at RM7 flat rate after 6pm. Friendly n helpful staff, good atmosphere, buffet line nothing exciting but dessert is good. good discount for Accor members. Being Accor member, it was a good bargain for 50% off. But if at full price of RM$75 for lunch buffet, may be a bit steep for the variety offered. Food variety is soso. Service is good. Need to really q up for shasimi. Rather top up more to dine at other restaurant for buffet for better variety and quality. surprisingly...only serve plain water, coffee or tea, no softdrinks at all. I had breakfast here four days in a row, included with my stay at the Pullman. It is a good quality buffet but dies have a relatively small selection compared to other hotels of similar quality. The omelette station was a personal favourite. They went a little OTT with the ginger at the Smoothie station and the cereal selection was very limited. Supplying room service bar food and Club they really need to provide one vegetarian option, more in the room service, change and update their menus that have been the same for over 8 months.",3.5,11,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

The taste is good the service is fast but just the staff at the cashier are not that friendly. So far the food were good and the price it's worth it. This is one of the nasi lemak place that you should try especially if you need some foods at night. The sambal is quite unique, it has smoky flavour and overall it was delicious. TBH i will give full rating if their staff could at least smile a little bit. I know she was pregnant... Anyway, the nasi lemak was good and will come again later. I tried the nasi lemak chicken at setapak area. Very good. I think they have a lot outlets. The fried chicken is delicious and not oily. It's freshly fried too. The reasonable price at RM 6.00. Restaurant is open concept. Halal food. Mali's is a legend when we though about char kuew teow. If you looking for good char kuew teow and nasi lemak around taman melati. Just go straight to Mali's Corner. Let the ""kuali"" dance in front you. Mali's Corner ~ a perfect place to find char kuey tiaw n nasi lemak in the middle of da town... two thumbs up!!! You just have to try the char kuew teow special! Soooo many prawns, I lost count...yeah, que a bit turn off but that's bcoz soo many people flock there.

Lots of varities nasi lemak lempeng traditional kueh its all well prepared and its sooo tasty and delicious.. tasteful..so many dishes to choose... reasonable price.. strategic place..full of sweet smile..food freshly bake.. awesome.. Awesome food I had in KL.. Nice embience trust me one I came in I have good feeling, relaxing with live music good servise from crew very friendly I gave 'A' from the experience I had dine in here. A wonderful little coffee house in the middle of TTDI. With wonderful ambience and decor depicting scenes of Johor in the 40’s, d’Cengkih serves a delightful mix of delicious Johorean dishes. Very tasty and authentic Malay food - lots of Johorian choices probably because they are from Johor. Cosy environment. Like the shop music traditional Malay or Indonesia gamelan. Johor theme. Tasty food mostly. Well maintained n quality goods n services used. Price bit high side but acceptable. A better place to get Malay dishes albeit the crowd n difficulties in finding parking spaces. Over flowed crowds n most of the times not enough seats..have to wait a while for vancancies..but worth it..do try their mee rebus n longtong kering.. The owner provided seats though along the walkway n at parking lots in front esp during weekends...maybe a need to move to larger premises just not to frustrate diners...just a suggestion. As upmarket Malay restaurants proliferate in KL, this is one of the older, but hip and modern ones. With live music evenings and a hipster meets makcik vibe, D'Cengkih really reflects its trendy but unpretentious urbane middle-class neighborhood, Taman Tun Dr Ismail, in its decor and patrons. The food is from the southern state of Johor, but like the melange that is TTDI, it's truly Malaysian. Try it all! This restaurant is at Taman Tun Dr Ismail. The food n kuih are super tasty and delicious. Dishes like asam pedas, ayam bakar lemak, ikan keli bakar in lemak gravy and ao many type of veggie, sauces! Another must eat is the banana pancake (lempeng pisang). it i super soft n the taste of banana is so tasty. U can take MRT to TTDI station and walk 5-10 mins. Or just take grab/uber! The food was good, and they have quite a wide selection of food, but they are very expensive! Despite that we went there for 4-5 times already. Again, food's good but expensive.",4,28,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

It goes with my taste buds. Very comfortable area and nice decoration for some time i feel i am in india Rajasthan. Good for group at dinner. Buffet for RM 37/- can try almost all menu for this price. If go by ala carte price will be bit expensive. We of two families had dinner twice at this place. For the touchy ones from us needing non onion, garlic preparations, Mr Kiranjit Singh Rekhraj personally ensured that the food items were perfectly matched our requirements. Dosas, paneer masala, Dal, rotis ,curd were offered along with papads. Highly enjoyable items. Recommended for discerning tourists. The restaurant is very welcoming, clean and big. The owner welcomes you with friendship and kindness. To us, tourists, he explained every dish, every drink and some rituals that were made during dinner. The food is very good, delicate and the quality is high. Quality and price, excellent! It is worth to pass, just only for the friendly atmosphere in the restaurant. We decided to visit the Royal Darbar for our evening meal whilst being on a short stop over holiday in KL. We walked in and were greeted by a friendly man who explained we could choose the buffet option for 35RM including drinks, or the à la cart instead. GiGi being vegan was kindly informed of the buffet items that she would be able to eat, and it was a fair option. The waiter actually walked us around the buffet table and explained each dish. The waiter then allowed us to look at the à la cart menu too so we could decide between that or the buffet. He also let GiGi know that if she was interested in an item he would be there to let her know if it was vegan. We chose the buffet option and all of the food was flavourful and yummy. Another good aspect was the fact that quite a few locals were dining there also which we always reckon is a good sign. All in all the restaurant was a pleasant experience. Only downsides were the bathroom wasn’t the nicest and the lock seemed unsafe, and also there were no vegan options for dessert not even any fruit which was a little shame but not the end of the world. Fantastic meal in a quite location, Close to the Hilton Garden in which is where we are staying. Not a single thing we had was anything less than excellent but the mutton Kebab cooked in the tandoor was the beat mutton I have ever had. The staff were very helpfully friendly and attentive and it was inside with good AC and a nice clean tidy environment. Would 100% recommend. I just absolutely love the food in here really authentic full of flavour. The staff are very helpful and attentive. I give the food an 10/10 full of foavour fresh tastes. Mutton Rogan Josh highly recommended and my wife loves the biryani. Also the decor be is modern and all furniture in there new. very nice food very good price the staff are friendly portions are perfect good quality indian restaurant top 10 feeds in a while all 4 left with a smile. I was a vegetarian and was skeptical of the veg food here. To my surprise the food was delicious and we all loved it. I felt like eating homemade food relishing the Indian spices blended in a perfect way. Navratna korma and Malai kofta were just as I prefer to eat. The chefs are well trained in their service and are highly specialized in preparing the flavourful Indian food and have great knowledge of different spices and their effect. The dining atmosphere was splendid and was great to relieve stress and elevate mood.",4.5,15,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Thier speciality is the fish-head curry - but you can get all the seafood - tiger prawns and other fish cooked in the same sort of gravy. Alos a lot of other dishes that will make you want to go back for more. I've been there twice on my last two trips to KL and am waiting to visist again. I have tasted many Nasi Kandar in KL, but this restaurant by far serves the most authentic taste. It taste just like those Nasi Kandar I can usually get in Penang. The place is clean and spacious. They have various choice of dishes. The price is a little bit higher than average, but I do not mind to pay for good food! I went for there for buka puasa and took white rice, fried chicken (sooo yummy), hard boiled egg and curry sotong. And of course serve with mixed gravy or kuah campur taruk atas. It taste so good and very delicious until you lick your fingers! My boss took me here as when we were deciding where to go for lunch. We drove all the way from PJ as he told me that the one in Ampang Point is not as original as this one. I must say that he was right! The curry here taste almost the same as the one in Penang although it has been a long time since the last time I was at the one in Penang. What I mean is that curry from Penang has its own distinctive flavour/taste and this restaurant maintained the QC. My maiden visit here we had the fish head curry, sotong curry and the lamb shank. Burp! Parking was ample behind the restaurant. But please be reminded that between 12.30 - 1.30pm the place is pack. So timing to reach there is important. We were cautious of the hype as this is the KL branch of the famous Nasi Kandar Line Clear of Penang. So could this restaurant live up to the 'legend'? As far as the food is concerned, that is a big YES!!! The Biryani rice was tasty but what made it excellent was the combination of all the curry gravies ('kuah banjir') that was added to the rice. The mixture at first looked alarmingly scary but somehow, the flavours just seemed to blend so well with just the right amount of spice and heat. We enjoyed the rich Mutton Curry. The mutton was cooked perfectly; the meat was tender enough not to require a jaw workout but not to the point of disintegration upon touch. The fish curry was good; not too sour and very tasty, though the fish did seem a bit 'fishy'. The fried fish and fried squid were well-seasoned; a little overcooked but this was the norm for nasi kandar style of cooking. Even the fried vegetables were tasty. We enjoyed the ginger teas ('teh halia') that we ordered to go along with the tea. The beverages were not too sweet as we requested and there was enough of ginger to give that extra heat to the creamy sweetness of the brewed tea. The service was decent enough; we did not face any rudeness or apathy. The waiters were very obliging when we deliberated over which table to occupy. Beverages were served promptly and the food was dished and delivered as ordered. For food of this quality, the price was pleasantly reasonable. Lunch for three people consisting of three generous servings or rice, mutton curry, fish curry, fried squid, fried fish and an assortment of vegetables plus five servings of tea cost us slightly over RM56 (less than US$13!). That felt like such a value-for-money deal for such an enjoyable meal. Overall, it was a satisfying experience. The great food, good service and value-for-money pricing will certainly attract us to revisit this restaurant in the very near future. If the standards are maintained, it looks like we at least have an authentic nasi kandar restaurant in KL that is as close as you can get to the famous nasi kandar cuisine of Penang. If you really want to experience one of the local flavours, this restoran will not disappoint!! The Malaysian Mamak are Malaysians of Tamil Muslim origin (just a fyi for those who wouldn't know)! This restoran as they call it there offer a variety of dishes from rice to briyani, fried noodles, and other tasty curries, like lamb, chicken, fish head, squid!! Most of them wud be quite spicy! But the taste is really nice and a big choices of rotis to naan!! Worth giving it a shot if u want to experience the ""mamak"" food, one of the malaysian favourites.",4,24,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

But the price for me is a bit pricey for what we can expected. So for a complete simpls meal I can say for two person it will cost approx RM50 maximum. Just realised they have expanded their menu. But my favorite is still the boat noodle served in 2 different soup-one is sourish and the other bit creamy. Cant remember what is it called. Price is cheap but very small portion. Sometimes you just cant stop ordering for more. I would also recommend the thai iced tea. i love the ayuthayya chicken thai rice noodle . for who like to eat thailand foods you must try this mee sampan. Besides that i love their yum mama and sangaya. Noodles, satay and other snacks crowd this fast food place! Not a real option for dining but good one for a snack stop. Good offer for drinks (including cold coconuts, yeah). Nice flavor, quality ingredients and cheap price will do your night but be aware that portions are quite small. Recommended for foodies and first-time travelers. I imagined it would just be a very tiny bowl of noodles in a common hawker- taste broth. But I was wrong, it was so good. I personally love the beef ones more than the chicken's. The broth was unique, very appetizing, sour with a tinge of spice, not spicy hot, just right to make your mouth salivate. It's now one of my favourite savoury foods. It also reminded me of Thai food. The noodles was springy and fresh, I love chewing it and slurping the whole bowl of broth in one go. There's a tray of chili flakes, pepper and other condiments to add on to your liking. They even put in beef ball or shredded chicken meat for only RM1.90 per bowl. You can order as many bowls as you want and there're two flavours of broth to choose from. It seems that this place is very much approved by local specially youth in KL. As tourists we enjoyed the food very much. because every plate has little amount of food, it gives you the chance to try different dishes. And it is very cheap! BTW, I prefered if they care more about hygiene! This is my first time to dine in at this branch. Similar to other branch. The restaurant is quite big here. The service was quite fast. Love their boat noodle and the beef ball. Please try their ice tea and ice green tea! Being to the Sunway Putra Mall Boat Noodle branch. Fantastic place. Vibrant, full of people waiting to be seated. Portions small but tasteful--no wonder people lining up to get in. Delicious fare. A very bright sign of ""BOAT NOODLE""--just can't miss it. Service sincerely & friendly but a wee bit slow. Loved the place. Well their famous menu taste is good , but they serve it in a small bowl and in small portion . It's only 2 or 3 scoop noodles for each bowl , well i should have 4 or 5 bowl all by myself to make me a lil full lol . Thats why when u googling ""Boat Noodle in KL"" , all the photos should be contained a tower of noodles bowl because u couldn't get full by only having 1 bowl of the noodles lol. Small portion and you can eat as much as you could. Food originally from Thailand and it's fun to eat with friends and family. Price is reasonable.

373,Pinang Masak,7.00 AM - 7.00 PM,"Laman Tunku, Kuala Lumpur 50480 Malaysia",None,None,None,"Serves Malay cuisine not easily found in restaurants. Quality could be better due to lack of better ingredients. Restaurant could also do with a good “clean and tidy up” to make it more appealing. Perhaps the proprietor should consider a good clean up and maintain the cleaner ambiance and use better quality ingredients. Pass the extra cost to the patrons as the location is upmarket and can afford it. It is located at a quiet place, a corner of a shop lot at the prestige Bukit Tunku, Kuala Lumpur. They serve an array of local Malay food and desserts. It is pricey for a place like this since it is self service. The local food is not really impressive but there was quiet a variety of Malay desserts served. Small restaurant just off the Jalan Kuching roundabout serving Malay food. Their nasi campur (with rotational side dishes) is not the tastiest but isnt bad either. Delicious laksa Johore, average laksa assam. Good variety of local kuih, decently priced. Fast service but it can get a bit tight during peak lunch hour due to the space constraint. Nestled cozily in Taman Tunku, this is a place to go for a fulfilling meal of Malay dishes that taste like your mother cooked it. The place is unpretentious with a touch of Malay culture. The service is good as waiters are always at your neck and call for orders of drinks. Variety of dishes to choose from to accompany your rice or ask them to whip up something fresh and hot in the form of noodle dishes. I like Pinang Masak Cafe because the is cosy and comfortable. The food variety-main course to dessert. Breakfast and lunch always pack. Selection of kuih is amazing. Located in high end neighourhood of bukit tunku the food price to be honest is not worth it. Food nicer to look at but not really that great. We visit this restaurant frequently and they always have a great selection of freshly cooked local Malaysian food. The Nasi Lemak is excellent and the variety of Kueh is a highlight. The Ondeh-Ondeh is yummy ! I like Pinang Masak Cafe. It's a simple place - cosy enough and comfortable. They do have an amazing selection of kuih (traditional malay cakes/sweets) : but to be honest - they're nicer to look at, but not really that great when you eat them...although it is getting very difficult to find really good Malay kuih these days. Their food is average - makes for a good meal, but you won't exactly be dreaming of the food when you leave. But what is really good is the service : even with the crowd and at times chaos during peak meal hours, the service staff are great - genuinely friendly, helpful and knowledgeable - a refreshing change from the ever-dropping standards of service you get at food outlets these days. Will I go back? Yes. I may not go out of my way to go back, but if I'm around the area and looking for somewhere to have a meal, I will go back to Pinang Masak Cafe. This is the place to get an authentic malay food. The food is variety -main course to desserts. Lunch time is always pack. As it id located in high end neighbourhood of bukit tunku the food price stands but worth it as the quality and the taste are outstanding. The service that you will received here is excellent. The only setback is the place is quite small but dont worry about the food coz it is always fresh and tasty. Good place to hang out with friends especially in the evening. This place has many selections of great tasting local Malay dishes and desserts offering satisfying traditional meals. Ambience is simple and service is fairly quick.

Thanks. An impressive clean place, full of locals and tourists alike, absolutely buzzing. Big range of ethnic cuisines and local dishes, with friendly attentive service from the stall holders. Enough variety here to have lunch every day for a month and never have the same thing twice. Highly recommended and super great value for money. You can have a big meal and a drink of under RM20. Of all the exotic food I ate in Malaysia there is none I loved more than the Dragon fruit. Until I went to this market I had no idea that there were two types of the fruit, red and white, and My Food Loft allowed me to overindulge. do you know that you dont have to go to the expensive chinese restaurant in a five star hotel to be entertained by the tea pourer but get the same thrill wo paying through your nose? i am referring to the maker of mee tarik (pulled noodle) at My Foodloft KL Sentral. Hailing from China but from the muslim regions, the mee tarik maker is an expert at making noodle from dough with his hands, ending with a mesmerising demonstration of pulling it effortlessly without breaking, before dumping it into the hot soup. One can choose between soup or the dry version with toppings of beef, lamb or chicken. whichever you choose, the taste is heavenly as unlike the usual noodle, the texture and way it is made accounts for its much better taste.Try the lamb ramen-you will come back for more. I buy chocolate at the entrance to bring back home for my family, the price is cheaper than chocolate sold in Central Market or Petaling. Not that much difference, but RM1-2 difference is worth for me. I ate at Di Naina restaurant for twice and you really should eat here!!! There's many kind of rice menu and the price is soooo affordable! It's cheap! I spent RM15 for two portion Nasi Goreng and Teh O Limau! taste? Don't worry, the staffs are humble and friendly! He even remember me because I ate here for two days consecutive and ordered Nasi all the way. I went to this place on last week of April. The shop that selling all curry and Laksa look quite good. The price was only 9.90 ringgit for a bowl of yummy Assam Laksa. The portion was generous. The soup was full of condiments, Sweet and sour, lot of fresh veggies and pineapple. If you want a quick eat at KL Sentral but on a budget try this food center just beside the KTM ticķet counter. I ordered for a hot soup for only 10RM and juice for 8RM I get a full meal already. Many Asian food available and enjoy eating with a background music and clean and cool area. Located inside Kl Sentral.

The food is simple and the service fast, however the kitchen seems to struggle to deliver the meal complete (between first and last dish, it took a while). If you are looking for a quick fix in Vietnamese cuisine, this may be the place. Nice soupy noodles laced with top grade ingredients. Friendly waiters too. Healthy option for the whole family. Having just gone back from out of town, we were craving for a nice bowl of pho and fresh produce for our lunch yesterday. We were recommended to try the Super Saigon in Sri Hartamas with its lovely terrace. Our fresh chicken and prawn rolls were sumptuous with the filling. My tofu bun cha was satisfying. My family’s raw beef pho orders met their expectations. I’m glad that I could also just order a side of noodles with extra soup for my youngest. It helps to avoid food waste when restaurant accommodate such special requests. Been wanting to eat here and finally made there last week.it didn’t disappoint me at all.my beef pho was delicious and the heart attack fried rice was also yummy.i came all the way from doha and its the best pho I have eaten.the cafe is cosy and nicely decorated.will definitely visit the other outlets the next time I’m back in malaysia. Excellent chicken and beef brisket Pho. Chicken was so tender and flavorful. Also had the chicken and shrimp spring rolls. I suggest a stop for a great lunch. If you come there for pho, you’ll get good pho. The drinks are nice but a little on the sweet side. The other items on the menu are a little hit or miss. I feel like the restaurant could benefit from a bit of variety. But if your intention is to just get a bowl of pho, this place won’t disappoint. Visited this place twice. The first time I visited this place was way back in 2017 methinks on a weekend. The place was crowded but service super good. I had chicken breast pho and hot Vietnamese drip coffee with milk, and they tasted pretty legit, almost like the ones I had in Hanoi. The second time I visited this place, it was also crowded with the office crowd. Again, service was quick despite full patronage. Again, food wasn't disappointing. Ordered the same chicken breast pho and hot Vietnamese drip coffee with milk. Except this time round, I made the mistake of not checking my receipt and I ended up paying extra for my meal. Within 3 hours of reporting the incident on their Facebook page, I have received a refund of the mistake. This is dedication not seen in other restaurant! Two thumbs up! I was pleasantly surprised at how good this chain restaurant was. Located in a great spot. Thumbs up for the menu, which isn't too big and subsequently does a few dishes very well. The ambience was lovely, with both inside and outside areas to sit. We went on a Sunday, which was busy, but didn't slow down the speed of service or indeed the quality of food. The beef in the Pho was particularly good quality and generous. They were very kid friendly without detriment to other diners. We will definitely go again. My family and I tried to find a restaurant that serves hot healthy soup and we found this Super Saigon at Sri Hartamas. The location is very convenience. The ambience in the restaurant itself is really nice. You can choose to sit inside or outside. We also need not to wait for a long time to be served. They waiters were friendly. My recommendation of foods to eat will be special beef/chicken combination, medium rare sliced beef, sliced chicken and mince chicken & prawn spring roll. All of these menu will be served with vegetables and bean sprouts. You can ask for more vegetables as complementary. One of Halal Vietnamese Restautant in KL.. The food is nice, must try their pho, sandwich and coffee.",4,23,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Everything tasted good except the green curry where there was a smell to the chicken. The pandan gula melaka cake is fantastic (at RM12/slice) it’s better than what I tried at a cafe in PJ. Nice ambient with decent and variety of Asian style food.. Very clean.. Just a little pricy.. But tasty and worth the money. The environment here is wonderful and food is delicious, especially the curry mee and mee mamak, Must try!!! Baba Nyonya can guarantees a hearty meal that can satisfy even the most demanding foodies. At a budget-friendly price, no less! Comes with a bunch of friends, everyone can be seen enjoying the food to their hearts’ content from the first dish till the last dish served. The food are fresh and extremely tasty, with affordable price. Also, The name is not just sophisticated, but the decorations in the Nyonya restaurant itself give you a deep Baba & Nyonya feel. A homey and inviting eatery, this restaurant has won the hearts of many Nyonya’s foods lovers, of course including mine as well! Thumbs up to you! Decent lunch at Baba Nyonya. Nice environment with excellent food and great customer service. Will definitely come back again for the food! Brought my customers here for the 3rd visit. The quality of the food is so consistent after several months. Service is excellent and efficient despite the huge crowd during lunch. I love the mee mamak accompanied with kapitan chicken. The food ordered was exceptional, delicious and well presented. Great ambience and friendly staff. We had a great evening, the price was also very reasonable and combined with great service, will definitely come back! Authentic Nyonya foods are served at here! Good environment with special decor in the restaurant. Easily accessible by public transport as it at KLCC LRT station. Love the relaxing feel concept in the restaurant. Great concept. Love the classic nyonya food taste. Wide range of food and desserts. Yummy & strong santan curry taste. Service good & great place to spend with your family.",4,26,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Loved the garlic naan and the spiced curry. Lots of vegan selection as all good Indian places. We came in at 12.20am after calling and making a reservation. The food was fantastic and the service from Taufiq was beyond excellent. However, the manager was annoyed the boys had taken us close to closing time which when we called to check was 2.00am. Rather piqued that the manager had that attitude and kept scolding the boys who were at that ungodly hour giving us a fabulous service and great food. That manager will definitely be the downfall of the place. This southern Indian restaurant makes the best roti planta gula I ever had. If you have no idea what it is, just come here and have as a desert. It’s truly unreal. It’s a type of mild cheese that is spread ultra thin and fried. It’s sweet but cheesy and has a crispy yet sticky texture. Truly divine in admittedly not special surroundings. Absolutely recommend coming here for breakfast. It's delicious. Make sure to be early if you want idli, because they do run out. I was searching veg food in bukit bintag kualalmpur. Anyone told me about that restaurant. Really very tasty food I feel like India.  Went for shopping in Bukit Bintang , someone recommended me for veg food . Had an dosa and Maggi goreng . Food quality was good . The sambar and chutney qualities were also good . This place serves both veg and non-veg food. I wanted my fix of banana leaf rice and since this was nearby our hotel, we went there as I didn't know of any other options in the area. The food really hit the spot. I had fish and my husband had chicken. The accompanying veges were good too. Even tried the curry puff, vadai and that donut-like item and it didn't dissapointed. Craving fixed. I went there along with a friend and we ordered Chicken Biryani, Chicken Banana leaf meal, Milo Ais, Tea panas, Chicken paratal, Roti canai, Orange Juice and Idiyappam. Our total bill for all the above items was just 54.40 Ringitt. The restaurant was clean and the service was also nice. I liked their banana leaf and chicken biryani. The orange juice was not that great and the only thing bad was that some of the foods were served cold.",3.5,102,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Also try the fried noodles, along with the rice in the pineapple. Since many restaurants at ground floor were full, we went up one floor higher and found this restaurant. Being a No. 1 Thai food fan, I always ‘don’t mind’ going to any Thai food restaurant to try out. We ordered our favourite Mieng Kam, Pineapple Fried Rice , Fried Chicken Wings, Seafood Tom Yum, Pad Thai and Mango Sticky Rice for dessert. All food were delicious with authentic Thai taste. All ‘cukup rasa, cukup pedas, memang sedaplah...’. Will definitely come to this restaurant again but maybe to other branches. I write re their branch at 1 utama ,Petaling Jaya. Excellent friendly service,Thai style politeness,exuberant staff,efficient and swift.We ordered Thai mixed vegetables and green curry chicken.Food tasted fresh and delicious,moderate servings,with hot Chinese tea and 2 plates of rice.Good homelike cooking,nothing spectacular but we loved the green curry in particular...not too spicy and hot...just nice.Bill charged was moderate,relaxed ambience with lots of wood, comfortable furniture,overhead lights ..rustic feel...4 stars. We came here as we were craving something a little bit different, and considering Thailand is right next to Malaysia we were with this restaurant. We weren’t very adventurous with our choices - I opted for the Thai green chicken curry and my partner the pad Thai, and the flavours were exceptional, but the portions for the price were just far too small. Food was good. It is a nice place so you pay slightly more, but it is honest. Service was good and prompt. We would definitely come back. Nice food cooked in traditional Thai style. However the restaurants is crowded and service did not improved and still not too happy with it. The Chilli beef and basil took me straight back to Thailand. Very reasonable price what more can you ask good food good beer good price. Definitely worth a visit. We went to Absolute Thai @sunwayputramall which was absolutely amazing! The best, most authentic, Thai food u will find without actually being in Thailand. The Tom yam soup, is life changing. The depths of flavour in one soup is just delicious! The pad Thai, Thai fried rice, pineapple rice, prawn Thai omelette, the spring rolls filled with glass noodles and served with home made sweet chilli sauce, the Thai salads (especially the green Mango salad, with crispy catfish), to name but a few dishes are absolutely amazing the best food we’ve eaten in a while.... highly recommend if u love Thai food!",4,160,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

If you like Udon you can definitely go and enjoy a bowl. It's located on the highest level in the center of the Midvalley Megamall. During lunch and dinner, it can be crowded and bit hard to find a table. From the order to start eating it takes just a few minutes. Because I like Udon I visited this location several times and never been disappointed there. Fast , self service udon restaurant, pick your choice of tempura , I had the beef chili udon which was good , refillable green tea , so far so good for a quick lunch. WE come for the late lunch . Great place to have HALAL- certificated udon noodles in town. Some thing new to have varieties of udon taste.Felt in love with their way of cooking half-melted egg. First thing, the mall is enormous. You will get most of the brands here and most of the chain restaurants. Place gets a lot crowded on weekends so try and visit the mall on weekdays. Please note that the place has long queue for changing forex, but rates are very good. Great place to have udon noodles. More like a fast food restaurant!! It's a compliment actually. Just queue, place your order and wait to collect your food , pay and enjoy your meals. Will definitely be back next time. Easily one of the best udon I've ever had - just for the simplicity and great ingredients. The udon is fresh and light, the broth flavourful w a gentle punch, and the egg done just nice. Quick and friendly service, clean and warm ambiance, and best of all, so reasonably priced! And to top it off, rm1.50 refillable green tea. Can't beat that. The udon noodles are thick and the beef is quite tender. Whenever I am in Mid Valley Megamall I will come here for my lunch. The price is quite reasonable.I was surprise to see a foreigner serving instead of a Japanese. We constantly visit this outlet until they open another at D'Pulze Cyberjaya. We love the Udon so much that we have to have it every week. The Udon is at reasonable price but the prices of tempura spread is slightly on the higher side. If you are a traditional udon lover, this is place to visit. Plain traditional udon just fine. No need heavy soup. Plain soup with some tenkasu, just satisfying. Just beware of crowd as it is operating like a canteen(shokudou). Well worth your time. Plain and beef Udon plus tempura is very nice. Atmosphere is good and love the refill or green tea. Condiments counter is also a good idea, gives a Japanese feel.",4,24,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Marvelous , crisp deep fried kampung chicken , moist to the bite. So too were the asam pedas fish and squid sambal. Variety of menus specialised in Malay cuisine. Delicious.

Cutleries and plates are a bit too old which should be changed. Service is good. They also have grill fish and ala carte menu. Having my first time lunch here. The place is clean and nicely decorated. This restaurant serves variety of local Malay food for lunch. The foods tasted good. It was very crowded during lunch time. Eventually found the restaurant after a merry go round. We were there at 11.20 am but the gate was tightly locked. Actual dining time only allowed to start after 12 noon..Dishes were delicious but unfriendly services spoiled every bit of our appetite. I had a lunch today with two Sudanese friends, one of them visited Tupai Tupai earlier with me and found that the restaurant was unique and insisted that we re-visit only this time, with her brother together. Nonetheless, one of the stuffs whom came in while all food were laid on our table, came in with an un-usual high bill at RM 76.00 for dishes made for two person-1 pc of ikan pari, 1 pc of ayam Kampong , 1 pc of Ikan Cencaru , one small plate of rendang daging, and one small plate of kacang buncis.I reminded to him that the dishes were all for two persons though we had 3 plates of plain rice. Towards the end of our meal, I asked another worker to come and check the bill again, Based on his observation, he gave another bill which stands half the price at RM 38.90. The food taste good. The place is nice. Its like having food in hometown. Woods in the city environment. The waiting time is acceptable. Visited Tupai-Tupai on 28Dec2014. We've reached the restaurant 3pm+ and it was quite empty which didn't bothered us(14pax) at all. Upon our arrival, we were informed that the buffet is only available in the early evening and only ala-carte is available, which is fine. Staff was helpful and answered all our queries on the menu since we're not from there. Waiting time for the food was acceptable but most importantly, the food was GREAT! Salted-Egg Crab were most delicious for me. All other family members love it too. Oh yes! They were accomodating too. Since we have small children, we've asked for fried chicken that wasn't on the menu and they've accomodated accordingly. Overall, our experience was very good.

The menu is not big but also No spicy dishes that is not easy for Indian cuisine. We will go back for sure. Visited with my wife this evening. We had the vegetarian biriani, ladies finger and masala chicken. There was real depth of flavour to the dishes - very enjoyable. The street noise was a little overpowering during our particular visit- as there are industrial units a couple of door down. But this is not within the control of the restaurant. I was bit suspicious first. But the food came as a pleasant surprise. Got great combo options like set combos, al-carte, thali etc. Tava Chapatis are just like home cooked. I have been curious to try the lobster briyani as I love lobsters and I love briyani. The danger with lobster is if it is over cooked, which normally ends up that way with Indian cooking, the meat becomes tough and no longer enjoyable. I ordered the lobster briyani a day in advance as they require as they get it fresh daily. I got to the restaurant and I was not disappointed. The serving comes in a huge pot sealed with dough to seal in the goodness and is unsealed in front of you. The aroma that fills the air is sufficient to satisfy you when it is opened. The lobster was huge - enough to feed two hungry people and the rice is enough to feed four people. The lobster was perfectly cooked still dripping in its natural juices and was so flavourful with the briyani spices. The rice was fluffy, flavourful and perfectly spiced. It was not overpowering at all and I couldn’t have asked for a more perfect meal. As a food connoisseur who is not easily satisfied with Indian food, I thoroughly enjoyed this dish and I highly recommend Fierce Curry House’s Lobster Briyani which has now become my favourite Indian dish! You will not be disappointed.. yesterday i ordered chicken tikka masala, fish curry, 2 plain briyani rice, garlic cheese naan, 1 tea and 2 tea masala. all of them costs me around 105 RM. yesterday i ordered chicken tikka masala, fish curry, 2 plain briyani rice, garlic cheese naan, 1 tea and 2 tea masala. all of them costs me around 105 RM. the briyani rice kinda average. but not bad! still liked it. and also the size is so big.... we eat 2 rice for 3 adults! and for naan, personally i regret choosing cheese garlic. the flavors is too strong if you want eat it with the curry. i should have ordered a plain one... so you can dip the naan to the curry, and eat the remaining sauce! We hadn't ordered the lobster 24h before but the head chef personally greeted us and said he would give us the next booking's lobster and buy another for them. He insisted the lobster must be a minimum few hours old otherwise he will refuse to serve it- very impressive. The dish was wonderful. Lobster juices into the rice. Fantastic for instagram! We shared between two and there was plenty of rice leftover. I had a great meal here, fierce curry has good food and service. I will definitely go again. The garlic coriander naan went well with the curry, washed down with tiger beers.",3.5,126,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

We were staying at the hotel opposite, Saturday night was full, so we went there on a Sunday night. We ordered beer and prawn curry, Pad Thai, Chicken stay and butter chicken. The waiter put the prawn curry on the table two minutes after we ordered, before we got our drinks, and it looks like a bowl of soup more than curry, we were worried but it turned out really tasty and there were quite a lot of prawns. The chicken satay was really good! butter chicken is not what we expected but also taste very good, our daughter loves it! Pad Thai was amazing! Very big portion and it's one of the best Pad Thai we have ever had, we didn't expect too much but turned out really good and enjoyable, price was reasonable, only RM 180 for the 3 of us. Will definitely go again! Atmosphere and service was good too. i guess you come here for the location. The name of the restaurant sounds exotic but the food was average, bland and not memorable.

It was my first time here after a business meeting. I ordered a dry pan-mee noodle. Awesome! Not too dry just the right kind of gravy mix. I will definitely come back to try their curry mee. Just had one of the most flavorful curry mee. Finished all the soup. Also do try their homemade chili sauce when you order the fried fishcakes. It has good fire-power. Wanted to buy a bottle of their chili to take home, unfortunately it was sold out. Good and cosy environment. Nice to hangout. Curry Mee is simply irresistible. Will definitely be back. Being from the UK i must admit i am often very critical when trying out new restaurants for the first time. I came across Betty's today and found the quality of the food to be of a very high standard. I recommend Betty's Cafe to locals and anyone visiting KL for the day. After a day of shopping being able to dine in a friendly and welcoming restaurant makes all the difference. I was recommended to try one of the Curries and i must say it was fantastic. I will be back again on my next visit to KL. The curry chicken was superb and I enjoyed every single second of it. It's not always you get to taste good curry and the best part of it it's not those watery like based but it was thick based which made it great. The potato in the curry made it even tastier and it was just right which compliment one another. The Sambal was just nice and not too spicy. Like the fact that the sambal was made just right along with their sambal shrimp which went right with the curry. Best prawn mee soup...second delicious noodles was mee java...both are very tasty and the best i had before...keep it up! Delicious :) Had stumbled upon betty's cafe after my meeting at a clients place and im really glad that i gave it a try. HONESTLY, it was my 1st ever mee jawa experience.

HUUUGE variety of Indian, Malay, Western and Fusion food. Definitely recommended for group outings. Murni is well known for its food and it never disappoints. The service is prompt and the food portion is big. The only problem is that this place is very packed and you can be ""upset"" waiting to place your order. It's Malaysian comfort food and I have no qualms returning here again and again. Food always good. Just notice 1 improvement about this restaurant, previous time we need to pay at counter, nowdays, we can make a payment at own table and they will give you change directly without waiting. The portion is enough for you to share twi people. But if you love a large quantity of food, i would recommend you to go here. Delicious dish is nasi lemak ayam pandan. Smell of ayam goreng pandan. Yummmyyy! Big portion with reasonable price. The food is sooooo delicious and with variety of choices. Great chitchating place with friends. It has become one of my favorite restaurant. Everything is large portion. Our favorites are Lamb Chop, Chicken Mariland, and Napoleon. The place is like typical Nasi Kandar, so nothing special about the place. Mostly people go there with family. - is a Halal Restaurant - all the foods portion is Large so better 1 order share it with your partner - location at PJ SS2 gotta hunt for parking lot. The Food is also served in large portions, so its a Full Meal for you. The food in the menu crosses from many different themes as well. From Arabic, to Mediterranean dishes, Thai to Malaysian Cuisines. So there is a lot to choose from. This restaurant is fantastic for Family and /or large groups or even for couples. This restaurant however, does not serve breakfast or lunch due to its operational hours. Normally people go for Dinner or supper in here. The food prices is very very reasonable and the Taste is awesome. So its just right and gives great value for money and good taste in the mouth.

I will seen you after six months in my next trip. I have visited Chennai Express on multiple occasions and have always been satisfied. It serves South Indian cuisine with some North Indian options as well. It is a clean and air-conditioned restaurant. The food is tasty, and it is very reasonably priced. At times service could be a bit slow because restaurant gets quite busy at lunch hours. I strongly recommend this place. The food here is good though you normally have to wait at least 20 mins since its quite busy. The Kashimiri Pulau here is delicious with a combination of nuts and fruits to satisfy. The banana leaf set lunch here is a speciality and has an assortment of sides to go with white rice. Apart from these, the Rajasthani Bindi masala is our fave and can go with both rice and bread. The deserts are just okay. we had dinner here, all the food was so tasty and yummy, portion a bit small, but so flavorful, so many option on menu ,definitely will be back and try some other food. we taste Indian version of falloda so refreshing. This restaurant came highly recommended by friends and I decided to give it a try and boy, was I pleasantly surprised. The prices were very reasonable (if compared against some really exorbitant prices of nearby restaurants) and the food was delicious. The variety is also excellent with many choices for fish, chicken, mutton as well as vegetarian dishes. I've been there 3 times since and have never been disappointed with their food. The chicken briyani is simply amazing and I would definitely visit this restaurant many times more. Love their Coffee N Tea too!!! I've been to this place twice and find the food, service, ambience, cleanliness to be much better than off other restaurants. The good thing their price is reasonable. Good try and will return. Had lunch here three times in this month. The food is really good, if you're looking for authentic Indian food. The banana leaf Thali meal is really good & very filling at just RM7.90. I tried this twice on different days and the vegetable choices were different on both days. The naan and ala carte vegetable dishes are good too. the mutton kheema is a little too oily for my liking though. Do try the desserts, its good. 2 things that needs improvement is the serving time and hand washing area. There are 'call for service' buzzers on each table but the staff seem to ignore it at times. I notice staff daydreaming & clearing plates on a vacant table while i had already buzzed twice for a menu to order my food. Another time, I buzzed for the bill but the waiter was just staring into space and did not even hear. There should be a separate hand wash area so that customers do not have to go into the narrow unisex toilet just to wash hands. Once someone is inside, the next person has to wait till they exit, to go inside. This created a bit of a messy queue.",3.5,27,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

The breads we took had the taste of a real charcoal tandoor oven. The maitre d' was willing to take photos, and all at a reasonable price. Also a good place for a quiet meal - there was space and time in the resto for a good chat. This is a great place to go for a meal out with friends - low-key and friendly, with knowledgeable waiters to help you choose from the menu. Each dish we tried was a delight - the chicken roasted outside on the spit was juicy and flavoursome, the nan were freshly made, warm and soft, the various dishes which arrived at the table each had their own spices and flavours. I would definitely recommend coming away from the Golden Triangle to explore another area of the city and to taste the authentic Indian spices and cooking of this lovely restaurant. Good quality food at an affordable price and clean environment. One of the Best Indian Restaurant in KL. The food was great. I loved especially the Keema Naan and the butter paneer masala. The chicken briyani, chicken tikka masala and prawn masala was nice too. The atmosphere was good, I felt like as though I was in India. With many people, it was noisy, nevertheless, we enjoyed chit-chatting among our family members. We had great time! Good and Tasty Food. I like South Indian Non Veg Meals. Best South Indian Restaurant in KL. Affordable Rates.Very Good restaurant in Malaysia.  Always excellent and spicy south Indian food. My preferences have always been the dry and wet mutton curries, and the masala chicken coupled with a good serving of biryani or yellow rice. Don't forget to slop on some of their chicken and/or fish curry that comes with the meal onto your rice. Enjoy! Outstanding menu, service, and of course food! One of the best Indian restaurants I have ever been in. I really love the atmosphere with the Indian music. I really recommend people to go this restaurant if they want a taste of India! I was taken to this unassuming Indian restaurant located in Bukit Jalil, Kuala Lumpur for a business lunch. It was the best meal I experienced during my visit. The restaurant I learnt is family owned and uses fresh ingredients to create mouth watering authentic cuisine. The menu caters for both non-vegetarian and vegetarian diets with the menu including both South and North Indian styles. There is a particularly large range of delicious naan breads on the menu. The palak paneer was particularly memorable. Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner it is an ideal location for a family gathering, special celebration or working lunch with colleagues. Mallikas restaurant is one of the best india restaurant in the Bukit jalil. This is the best family dining restaurant in this area. We went to celebrate a birthday occasion. We ordered biryani, mutton barra kebab, pomfret fish, nun ,butter chicken masala, paneer tikka masala and mutton chukka The biryani was fabulous .I love the mutton barra kebab and pomfret fish. Each and every item was delicious and mouth watering. The ambiance was quite classy. Overall we had a good experience there. This restaurant is a right place for Week end dine esp if you love native Indian food. Below are the items which impressed me based on my mouth experience.",4.5,33,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

We didn’t get to sit at the restaurant cos it was closed for a private party and we sat downstairs at Tiju instead . We tried 3 discusses - appetizer , fish saffron and paneer curry ! We both loved it and will comeback to try others ❤️ Was taken by surprise by the quality of food. Thought it would be mediocre given that this place seemed more like a bar (which it is) than a restaurant. It is loud inside, but the DJ was hitting all the right music so I didn't mind too much. The late night happy hour is really good. Mainly though, the food is incredible. I can’t really tell whether the food is authentic Goan food or not as I’ve never been or eaten any Goan food but I can assure you that the food served is really good. Ordered the Goan platter that consists of most of Goa by Sapna’s signature dishes and it’s only RM58. Will definitely come back to try more. Limited options in the menu but food was great. People hankering for Indian fusion food shall be in for a real treat. We were very impressed by the freshness of the food and how delicious the food was. The service was excellent and the ambience was good. Quality service and quality food! MUST TO TRY ! YOU WILL NEVER REGRET! Me and my bestie had a very superb experience at the heart of KL. Food was so delicious and drinks was so freakin’ awesome. I can recommend this restaurant when it comes to ambiance and special menus most specially their Cocktails which has Indian touch. Absolutely incomparable among cocktails I tasted. Salute the guys in the entire outlet for a very heart warming welcome as we enter and left the place. Kudos pips!!! Keep it up. Ordered lamb and chicken as our main which were awesome! The staffs are friendly and attentive. Most of all, the ambiance was great as well - we love the songs that were played, the live band and the set up of the whole place . We had a wonderful Friday night spent there at Goa :) Goa By Hubba was a unique experience. The cuisine was truly Goan inspired - perhaps the only restaurant in KL offering this. The dishes were delicately done and delicious. Each dish seemed to highlight a unique flavour - the lamb and Bindi are particularly memorable. I plan to visit again with my friends. Really worth a visit especially for a special occasion! Goa by Hubba is simply amazing bar and wonderful and chill staff. The decor is very nice and it’s just chill to have beers or House spirits and talk with your friends. Affordable prices for evening time. I urge you to try the Bento box set lunch at Goa by Hubba. The zingy soup is packed with spices and flavour and the main dish is good too. I ordered the accompanying parathas instead of rice which was delicious!",4.5,26,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

I don't wanna try anything else. We tried several meals. They were all good but roti with lamb was the best. They serve it with three sauces. It's like a cherry on a cake. Delicious. I stumbled across this place when searching for somewhere to go for Roti Canai and Teh Tarik. It’s about 5 mins from KLCC (outside of rush hour). I wasn’t sure if it was the right place as it looked dead and had bare tables and plastic chairs. We ordered 4 x Roti Canai, 4 Teh Tarik, 2 x Roti and a small bowl of rice for my baby. Came in at just under 19RM ! When we were leaving, the place was full. Best Roti & Teh Tarik i've had in Kuala Lumpur! This place was my breakfast spot during my stay in KL. I always amazed by teh tarik which is having thicc foam. Obviously, but not making me surprised, the roti canai was so damn good as expected. Even, I still don't think this is the best one, but I love how they handle the customer by quickly serving. All the meals I got so fresh, still hot too. I tried their Nasi Goreng Kampung, and I love it so much! Nasi goreng kampung comes with Ikan Bilis, and quite spicy. But I will repeat again that I love it so much! This was the most delicious roti canai - hot, flaky and crispy. The roti boom, filled with butter and sugar, was also incredible. Everything is made to order but the service is very quick. For five serves of roti and four drinks we spent RM20 (~$7-8 AUD). This is a bit out of the way but was well worth the grab journey. We had read many reviews for the best roti in KL and Valentine Roti was often mentioned. They did not disappoint. We tried a wide range of roti over 2 visits- Canai (plain), Telur (egg), Tampal (egg fried inside), Kaya (coconut spread), Boom (sugar and butter), Milo (sprinkled with Milo powder), as well as Murtabak Ayam (delicious mixture of chicken and onions inside), Each visit, where we had 6 roti between us, plus delicious freshly squeezed fruit juices, cost around 30 ringgit (approx $10 AUD at the moment). A complete bargain for a filling meal for 2-3 people! The setting is not fancy, so don't be put off by the surroundings. A server will come to your table to take your order. The ones we had did not seem to speak any English, so we just pointed to what we wanted as our Australian accents saying the words seemed difficult fo them to understand. We ordered 2 at a time and when they delivered our order, ordered another 2 and they arrived pretty much as we were finishing the first lot. When it comes time to pay, go to the counter and the server will come over to tell the man at the register what we ordered. I was impressed that they remembered our orders so accurately! Definitely worth a visit. The roti canai was big but it didn’t felt it was heavy. Instead, it’s so crispy and light that one can probably have more than their usual serving. Love how they also provide the sambal with the curry without asking for it - authentic local style of eating roti canai. Order the one with egg too and it was also good! The dough seems to have infused with the egg, unlike the normal roti canai where there is only a portion where you can taste the egg. It’s definitely one of the best roti canai around KL. Crispy on the outside and fluffy from the inside Roti canai kosong is amazing. Combine that with their dhal curry is such a perfect match.",4.5,77,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Nice and cosy environment. Wide variety of choices no matter is Chinese, Japanese, Western, Indian etc, etc..... Quality of food is good. Service is also good. Fully recommended. Having dined @ link pullman for the past 2years has been a great one, service are top notch from reception/cashier to service staff clearing the plate... but dining here 1/2/2020 been a slight unpleasant one for me. Unpleasant in the sense I had to ask for more sashimi 3 times. I don’t waste my food unless the seafood are not fresh or the cooking didn’t suits me. Went to the sashimi counter asking for salmon and he gave me 3thin slice. When I ask for more, the Malay young commis chef or trainee gave me another 3 more thin slices. I went to him asking 3 times. Not sure is that a new requirement by management of f&b as I never encounter them previously @ whole year of 2018 and whole year of 2019. Felt irritated when I keep asking. I Didn’t felt good to approach the Japanese counter even I feel like having more sashimi. Other than that food has added vegetarian counter now. Buffet counter are nicely presented but the dishes seem less now for me. Would be nice to have Chinese New Year dishes or add in yee sang would be great. Dessert counter has no more chocolate fondue and marshmallow. The Link Restaurant is a great link to excellent and delicious Buffet spreads. Every dishes present were very tasty and popular among the guests and visitors. Excellent service and friendly staff. Excellent We love it. Will come again. We ate breakfast in the restaurant every day for two weeks. The buffet offerings were from across Asia and the West Different every morning, and always excellent. The staff is super attentive and pleasant, efficient, and professional. Breakfast buffet was like a breakfast trip around the world and I also enjoyed a delicious lunch sandwich with fresh-squeezed OJ. Wonderful lunch with a great spread of western, Chinese, Japanese, Malay and Indian. Sashimi was fresh and the desserts were wicked. Service was great with attentive and courteous staff clearing used plates fast and replenishing the food. Would definitely come again. Wagyu tomahawk is great and service is the best. Great option for sharing. Also tried their signature sushi. Japanese Chef, Chef Daud recommend us one of the signature sushi,spider unagi roll and the taste was really good. Very good value for money. Kudos to FnB Manager Mr. Zul for the great hospitality.",4,74,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

So far, all the food that we have tried here is amazingly delicious and I would highly recommend this restaurant. During the Covid19 pandemic, this restaurant practices the required SOP imposed by the government. The restaurant is clean, staff are friendly and the service is good. Ambience at the restaurant is very nice, properly lighted and has a comfortable sitting. As for the price, I would say it is very reasonable to what you enjoy there. There are ample parking lots in front of the restaurant, however as the restaurant is located at the busy street of Bangsar, you need to be early to find a parking incase if you have a lunch appointment. Otherwise you can just get a Grab or a taxi to go there. My friends and I had three types of briyani- chicken, prawn and another (can't remember the name), fish tikka, raita, chicken curry. All of the items were very yummy. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal. The fish tikka was superb and the condiments served together with it was also great. Ambiance was average but clean. Staff were efficient and service was good. Price was appropriate for the area. Good place, fairly priced menu. Food was vety good. It was not that crowded hence the exp was brilliant. This place doesn't accept cards, We definitely had a delicious meal in that place! The fish with curry was absolutely mouth watering! The service was also helpful! The place is a must! Went with my friends and family, best north indian food one can think of in Malaysia Amazing service and food quality. If you like Indian cuisine especially from North. This is the great place to go.

Customer servive was alright but the waiter who took the orders managed to forget a dish and it beats me why he wasnt taking down orders if he was going to have a minor slip in his memory. We only figured out the take away dish was not prepared towards the end of our meal which cost us an additional twenty minutes of waiting time. Otherwise place had a good ambience, peaceful and relaxed atmosphere. Food was suffused with subtle flavours, perhaps not as good as other peranakan based meals i have had, however the meal was still a satisfactory one. Price was reasonable as compared to kl standards however portion sizes were on the smaller side. The food is great as good as the Melaka Joknker street. The spicy sour fish and the laksa are superb. Had a sharing meal with family trying the variety of food. its all really good. We had dinner here with my group of colleagues after our breakout room games. The food was nice and the prices were quite reasonable too. This is my second time here. You need to make reservation as this restaurant is always full. Most Peranakan folks will usually claim that the best Peranakan cook they know is their mother. Being one myself, I certainly attest to that belief. So finding myself in a Peranakan restaurant, I decided to ask the waiter what his recommendation was, and he promptly suggested I try the beef rendang fried rice (huh?). But that was what I did order, and to be fair, it was pretty tasty. I agree with a previous reviewer that service could be a little quicker but there was a fair crowd in the restaurant even close to mid-afternoon on a weekday. What I really liked about the restaurant was the decor with the parallel strips of sarong motifs on one wall and the many colourful tiffin carriers near the wall. Food was really good, very tasteful and good portion. Service was good too. Deco was simple yet nice, felt like dining in a real Peranakan restaurant in Melaka or Penang. Price was good too. The place was bustling when we arrived at 2pm. Completely packed to the brim with office folks and robust conversation all around. There was music playing on top of the noise which was absolutely unnecessary and would recommend that management have the music turned off during such peak hours. The wait staff were completely disengaged when it came to taking orders and recommending dishes. We waited around 20 mins for our food to arrive and I gladly report that it did not disappoint entirely. Had lunch with my family here and we came at the busiest hour. Servers are still attentive despite the crowd. The waiting time for food was long but it was worth the wait. We ordered Peranakan platter,Nyonya platter and Nyonya Laksa.Verdict:hearty Nyonya lunch indeed. A restaurant serving nyonya food. The place is clean and bright place with ample seating. Staff were friendly and service was good. We ordered set meals for 7 persons and they were quite good. Will definitely go again. I walked past this place a couple of times and it was the only restaurant that was always full. We decided to have their Lunar New Year special Set A for MYR$168 for 4 persons. The Yee Sang was an assortment of shredded vegetables, accompaniments spices and raw salmon. There were very few small pieces of the salmon. All the other dishes were very nice except the fried chicken took quite a while. We order the ikan tempeh , ray fish with sambal and paku veggies. Honey squids is something different too.

Decent enough for a quick lunch while shopping. Had the gurami and i feel like TERBANG (flying). One of the best fish dish in KLCC area and that should be eaten with the spicy black soy sauce with chillies. You do not need to travel to Indonesia to taste good indonesian food. You can find a wide range of good food here. The set menu is reasonable. Not bad at all - Food was pretty good (except the green chili chicken thingy which doesn’t taste like authentic Indonesian). Staff was friendly. Didn’t have to wait too long for food. Give it a shot if you’re looking for Indonesian food. I got the spirit of Indonesia in this restaurant and ingredients of meals where fresh and tasty. Decoration was also authentic. Service ok and polite though too much staff is running around. What I was missing was alcohol: a beer with the meals would have been perfect and I can't imagine what the reason was for no alcohol, as neighboring restaurants serve it. Or is it religion ? What a pity in that case and how backward. Tasty Indonesian dishes but comparably expensive, excellent service, surprise at the end: service and tax added to bill. Excellent food, very good service, friendly and quick to respond to requests. The pan fried shrimp was absolutely delicious. Feeling like back to the Jakarta visit. I came here just to enjoy the lunch they may offer. Full of customers and the hospitality was great. Basically most of the cuisines are Malay padang style. Good for the family and people who choose rice as the main meal. For juices need to let them know if you are not the sugar friendly. Mine was s bit sweet though I asked for the less sugar. Overall this restaurant still nice and you may try and enjoy the food yourself. Wide variety of authentic tasting Indonesian food.. It can get crowded during lunch time (peak hours) so might be good to head there earlier. We went there to celebrate Mother's day a day earlier and ate the very tasty fried fish, chicken drumstick w extra spicy, lots of green chilies on top and brinjal with sambal.

Lots of choices at a reasonable price. Good Service. Very close to our Hotel Aloft. Looking for malaysian dishes, than surely a place to be in a great ambience and environment. quite good selection and choices. Situated at NU Sentral. My first bite of exquisite, authentic Malaysian cuisine at PappaRich in Nu Sentral, Kuala Lumpur. The restaurant is easy to find as it is just along the walkway at the second floor of the mall, almost just after climbing up the escalator from the Jalan Tun Sambanthan side. The place is so homey, though quite cramped and there's really a lot of people because it's a very popular resto in the metro. Once seated, you will be given a menu and an order form. Ordering is easy because you just have to write the code of the food you want to order in the form. I ordered, for example, N05 and D48 for Curry Laksa Special and Iced Honey Lemon Tea. This is very efficient for foreign visitors who are not so fluent in English and are afraid to talk to crew staff for fear of not being able to express themselves. When my order arrived, the food looked very different from what was on the picture, and I even suspected that I was given the wrong one but my newfound friend Mohd Syahirun Amin confirmed that it really is the one. The meal is so heavenly scrumptious and fiery for virgin tongues. It's a must-try! When I come back to Kuala Lumpur, I have to try other dishes in Papparich. All worth the money! Nice rich aroma coffee in stevia!One of the best i tried.Minimum stevia after taste and rich coffee aroma. The kaya is fantastic .Taste like the good old day home made kaya.Bread slide thickness is just nice . Quality of bread is good,chewy but will not stick to your teeth. Visited this restaurant to try to eat local Malaysian hawker food in style. It has a nice variety of local foods, and love the teh tarik. I went here few times because our hotel just walking distance from here. Price was reasonable and service was good. I've been here for breakfast , mid morning tea , lunch , mid afternoon tea , dinner & never disappointed by the food , ambience nor staff ... Relaxing place with strong wifi & pretty comprehensive menu for light tea or heavier meals with dessert.. Papparich serves a variety of good Malaysian dishes. I went for a meal and ordered the Char Kway Teow dish which was seafood and noodles. I also ordered the chicken satay. I had a coconut drink. I was impressed by the quality and quantity of food - as well the efficiency of service. The food was tasty. The coconut drink was nice and cold. This review is about the Papparich outlet located on the 3 rd floor of The Gardens mall.I visited it along with a friend and we ordered Hainan Butter Toast with Kaya, Cham and Milo Ais. The total bill was 18.40 RM. The toast was really delicious and just melted in my mouth. The Milo Ais was also very good but the best thing was Cham which is a mix of Coffee and Milk Tea.

The restaurant looks grand but the food and service is not aligned to the appearance of the restaurant. It does not looks so clean from inside and food quality needs to be better. There is no leadership around and did not see any manager except one guy busy on computer in the carpet shop - perhaps the owner. I believe this restaurant can be run much better as it is missing a lot of action despite the fact that its location is just great at the corner in the mall. Al Ammar on the opposite side beats this restaurant in everything. Before my travel to Kuala Lumpur, I looked for a Turkish restaurant in the city. I found and read the comments in Tripadvisor. I visted there for dinner. It is located at Pavillon Shopping Mall. I ate soup, meat (Iskender kebab) and desert (kunefe). All were very delicious. Restaurant was clean and well designed. If you are also interested in carpets, you can find many different carpets in the restaurant. I have also opportunity to meet and talk with Turkish owner of the restaurant. I also thanks him for his hospitality and kind interest. I visited Bosphorus restaurant 2 weeks ago. Pavillon mall and restaurants in it are fancy but Bosphorus is not. Prices are expensive but you don't feel that you eat in a fancy place. Drinks were really hot and ice was not even helped to cool them. Food was delicious but when we want melted butter for Iskender Kebap they bring us cold butter. I told the chef (He is Turkish) that i never seen a service in Turkey like this. He told me that somebody wants like it but pretty sure that he was lying. If you serve cold butter with Iskender Kebap in Turkey you must to close your restaurant. We lived in Turkey for a year, and so have developed a love for this wonderful cuisine -- and how wonderful to find this place in KL, of all places. I was skeptical, but was pleasantly surprised. Of course not everything was as good as we've had in Turkey, but it was all still very good, and I can recommend it gladly. Having never really eaten much Turkish food, we are certainly not experts on it but this food was delicious and we'll certainly consider Turkish restaurants more often now. I had a dish of spiced chicken over a creamy eggplant purée and it was superb - I'm getting hungry at the thought of it! My husband had a mixed grill platter and he loved every bite. The breads that accompanied the meal were fantastic as well. We're looking forward to tasting more Turkish cuisine soon thanks to this delicious experience! We spotted this restaurant by coincidence as we were shopping at the Pavillion. We ordered Iskender Kabab and Adana kabab. They were all yummy. The meat was tasty and Turkish Pizza (lahmacun) was also delicious. The puffy Turkish bread was spectacular and very tasty.. The waitress was attentive without being intrusive. Had dinner there with my wife. Ordered pizza and mixed grill - both are great. reminds us the good dishes that we had in Istanbul. Great place for anyone who wants to experience some Turkish foods. Price is on the high side though. My sister and I eat here recently. The restaurnat is decorated in a lovely fashion and the food was nice but not outstanding. Dont expect to be able to have a beer or wine here as you would be able to have in Turkey itself. None the less, nice pleace to try.",3,14,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

There have two outlets in Kuala Lumpur. This one is in the Setapak area...very successful opposite a Hospital. I'm told...it was so successful ""someone"" thought it a great idea to set up an Indian Casket shop next to it!!! Can you imagine the drama of early negotiations to get rid of this kind of tactic to oust competition? LOL!!!! Nevertheless...the restaurant, when I was there, was very busy! Why? Despite the caskets next door, the food tastes great! People there (customers included) are friendly! Quite delicious and reasonably priced. Not really big so don't come at peak hour (1pm) or you won't have a place to sit. The food at this restaurant are delicious, especially Malay food. I like Nasi Goreng Ayam. Their roti canai are the best . However during peak hour, there will no sitting due numbers of customer. And some time the food are comeout late. Please note that the food price at this shop quite expensive. If you need some Haslam is one place to go if you are in the vicinity. The variety of food served is quite good and service is good. I think this is the most favourite place to chillax as they has different menu at different time. For example, if you looking for some traditional bites, menu served around 3pm until 6pm. For Nasi Lemak, i suggest you to take Sambal Kerang (Shellfish Sambal). this restaurant is located near Tawakal Hospital in KL and it served both ala-carte and buffet-style of serving during breakfast, lunch and dinner (ala-carte only). I always come here with my parents during breakfast. The foods are tasty, cheap and many varieties. The staffs also are nice and helpful. An outlet where you can get home-cooked food. This is a favourite of my family especially to take-away because this place is always packed being strategically-located near a medical centre, a government hospital and offices. There is a variety of desserts and also noodles during teatime. There is another branch at Jalan Pantai but I have not had the time to visit it. Pretty good, well priced and, I guess, authentic Malay food. This restaurant is a short taxi ride from KLCC. Maybe worth it, maybe not. You sure won't find many tourists here if that's your thing. Clean and airconditioned with a variety of local food. Price is not on the cheap side but still affordable. Came here on a recommendation at another website. It is way off the tourist track of K.L and not a place most would visit. The manager even asked us why we came. It is owned by a Malaysian film director but it is very unassuming unlike celebrity restaurants just about everywhere else. Frequented by your average local. You can either order off a menu or help yourself to a buffet Malay-style (nasi kandur(sp?). Good Malay home cooking.",3,14,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

We enjoyed our dim sum lunch at Luk Yu Tea House. Most of the dishes we ordered were good. Service was very good and food served quickly once you ordered. Food standards has been consistent for the last few years. Keep it up! It was also value for money as it was not only yummy but the price was reasonable. The reason I have given an excellent rating. Fresh ingredients cooked to order. Never disappointed with either the noodle dishes or good and reasonably priced dim sum. Attentive and friendly staff. Ha, this is nice. I like the classic atmosphere. The food is great. The taste is not so rich. So, it is okay with me. The tea is refillable! So worth with the price too. One of my favourite place to have halal dim sum in KL. Been going to this place since years ago. Food is always good and the service is fast. I often dine at this restuarant and mostly at dinner time. Overall, the food is delicious, the environtment is good, and best place for gathering with friends or family.

We love the place, the food and the staff ad well. They are very friendly and know their regular customers. Keep up the good works guys ❤️ Shimp dumpling, fried long beans, shanghai xiao long bao, fried chicken and the list goes on..... not one dish you would not like. My European and US friends drive me crazy when they insist on eating lunch dinner lunch dinner there after I took them there .

Good place to business meet ups. Chit chats and lovely place to have conversations while u eat. Great service. Humble owner / staff. Just 4 people were eating there during our visit. Such a shame as the food was delicious and brilliant value. Highly recommended. This meal would have been very good in any LC city centre restaurant. Well cooked malay food in a cool restaurant, served by polite, helpful waiters in a beautiful building. I arrived at 2pm on a Sunday after my tour of the museum. There was only one waiter but I was the only diner so the service was fine though the waiter did not speak a word. The roast lamb was delicious and the tables seemed nicely laid. The floor was not properly cleaned but that did not affect my enjoyment of the meal. Just right for a museum restaurant. Fast service of tasty food.We enjoyed our food very much. The lamb was especially delicious. Yet as good as the food is, the elegant surroundings sort of steal the show. This entire building is drop dead gorgeous and the restaurant is not an exception. So glad we waited to have lunch here. The restaurant was slow and the service was good. I would definitely recommend and revisit. Went in after the lunch buffet was just over. Ordered the newly added Shaksouka which was poached eggs over tomato onion puree with naan bread. Also the chicken with butter rice. Both were yummy especially the chicken. Service was slightly on the slow side and it is pricey. However the coffee was great and I could have licked the sauce off the saucer. Highly recommend this restaurant. This was not an expensive meal, yet it was an excellent one. For the equivalent of USD $35/CDN $50, two people had an all-we-could eat lunch with bottled water, mango juice, and strong, but good coffee. I had the chicken dish, and my wife had the lamb. Both delicious. This was preceded by a buffet of Middle Eastern appetizers (unlimited helpings). The meal was ended with a choice of three desserts (again, unlimited helpings). Service was rather solemn, with no attempt at geniality or conversation. Tables are widely spaced, so even a full restaurant would permit diners to talk at a normal level of conversation. Yes we visited this place. Had a huge spread of dishes. What i loved was the cold coffee. Also its not very expensive at all.",4,51,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

By far the best shawarma I have ever eaten and the price is very fair! (about 2,5usd). High recommendations! The shwarmas served here are the best, and one must try it especially Chicken Shwarma & Shwarma Rice Meal. Amazing food Highly recommend Really fresh and home tasting arab food Will be going back to them again. We only had a chicken shawarma with hummus and a fatoush, plus 2 juices as we weren’t that hungry. The hummus was quite nice, very creamy, but the chicken was a little dry. The fatoush was probably the best I’ve had, however the bread wasn’t fresh at all. The juices we had were just blended fruit, as it should be. Very refreshing, not sweet. We’d have to have more dishes to give it a big thumbs up. Will be trying the take away shawarma sandwiches after watching them being made. Look super tasty and juicy for very little money. Love this place. Food ambience is excellent. My favourite is the lamb briyani with spicy sauce. Totally blow your mind out if you like lamb. My other favourite are lamb kebab and also the steamed lamb on tray. Tabouleh salad and fetush salad is good I always order that. And for drinks I love the lemon nana or pomegranate juice! End it with nice desert you can choose at the dessert rack and sage tea. Perfection.",4,14,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

We love the food very much. Consistency sometimes up and down but most of the time is accurate. Free refill banchan. Whenever we craving for Korea food this is the best place to go. We did try other restaurants but it's not match with our liking.We ordered 8 different dishes and were very pleased with most of them. The rabokki was overly sweet and the kimchi jeon was a bit dense/doughy, but other than that it was great. The kimchi jjigae was very authentic (besides obvious lack of pork option) and their kimbap and bibimbap hit the spot. Love love love their pastries! Their interior is truly beautiful! I love everything about this place! It's so close to KLCC which you definitely cant miss out this place! It is halal food. Food is good. Large potion. Variety of Korean food. Everything is nice. Don't forget to try the ice cream too. A new Korean food restaurant had just been opened at a new Melawati Mall. My family went there with the intention of having dinner at another restaurant, but walking past this Korean restaurant and noticing the steady stream of people entering to dine, we decided to give it a try. And it turned out to be a very wise decision because the food is simply delicious. We ordered our usual must have Korean selection – the Beef Bulgogi and Chicken Bibimbap. To top it up, we also ordered the steamed egg (Gyeranjjim) and a few cups of hot green tea. The main course comes with the 3 side dishes (banchan) and steam rice. The kimchi (one of the banchan) is simply delicious. The food was all served hot and was really appetizing. My kids loved the sauce (or gravy) from the bulgogi. The bibimbap was served in a stone bowl and it kept the rice warm throughout the dining process and the crispy rice at the bottom was so delicious. The owner (I presume) who is a Korean came over to our table to inform us that we can add chilli sauce and mix it up with the bibimbap to add taste and spiciness to it. We did heed his advice by slowly adding the chilli sauce as we don’t want it to overdo the spiciness for our kids’ acceptance. The deco in the restaurant is very simple but a quote in Korean on the wall is very heart warming. It is also translated to English as “Good Food Reminds Me of Mom”. And yes, most of us can relate very well to this quote as most moms can dish out the most heart warming food. I also see other patrons ordering food which were served in pot like bowl. I think it must be some noddle dishes. Will have to make another trip to try out the other food on their menu. Overall, it is a wonderful experience dining here. Staff are attentive and friendly. Food were delicious and authentically Korean. Price is reasonable considering that they are a restaurant operating in a shopping mall. I will return for the bulgogi and bibimbap when the crave for Korean food strikes me. We went here on day one after landing in KL. The food is awesome, lots of variety , extremely affordable prices. Very courteous and friendly staff. Delicious food, Went there every other day for the rest of our stay. Would highly recommend. The restaurant is in a shopping mall so I was reluctant. However the food was really good, authentic Korean. Employees are very helpful and friendly. I liked everything. Price was very reasonable.",4,51,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

This place serve very authentic Indian cuisine with great taste and affordable price. Highly recommended to visit.Nothing to look at from outside. Inside basic but clean and some nice decor. Good menu range. Had mutton Madras. Very good indeed. Literally melted in mouth. Didn't see alcohol but nice salt lasso. Outside area too. Will go again.The ambience was good .the staff are very friendly and i had ordered for rice and malabar fish curry which was excellent rich in taste and also tandoori chicken taste really great. Would love to visit with my family and friends here.It's one of the hotels make mouth watering recipes in Brickfields restaurants. Both Vegetarian and Non-veg food available here.A great discovery with cozy air-conditioned environment or outdoor seating. Tried their kadai paneer and Hyderabad chicken which were spicy and yet rich in taste, to go with freshly baked mushroom kulcha. Their mutton biryani was satisfying too.Food was incredible, best indian food i have ever eaten. Well presented and a clean place to cool off. Friendly helpful staff. Total bill $30 aust $. For a huge amount of spicy delicious curry and rice, plus three lassie drinks. We all lovefd this restaurant and would recommend you give it a try.The curries are delicious, especially the Palak Paneer, and the service is great. We loved the outdoor ambience the most since many places offering outdoor eating in little india are surrounded by noise and other passers by. Here it is a little more private.A lot of choices of South Indian food, friendly staff always have something new to recommend that is good.The shop ambiance was nice and the service was good too. All the Indian food was tasty, especially the paratta, palak paneer, chicken chetty masala, etc. As for non-indian food, the taste was average.We ate so much last night for dinner, I thought I would explode - it was so good, I couldn't stop.Butter chicken, fresh naan, the sizzling skillet with different meat and rice. All of it was excellent. Myself and 3 friends decided to pay a visit to Little India on NYE and stumbled upon this place. We had a table outside on the balcony which was really nice and with a good atmosphere. The food was really good, we ordered a Chicken Sagwala, Poneer Paratha and couple of spicier curries on the menu. Myself and a friend decided to share a curry however, I wouldn't recommend this as the portion sizes are quite small so each person would need their own meal unless you get a few to share together.",3.5,47,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Was in KL for a 5 day holiday & was staying at the Intercontinental KLCC... MBH is barely a 500 meter walk from the hotel, & seriously..... what a mouth watering joint!! Over the five day stay I samples many Indian restaurants, & tried different cuisines, but clearly if you're looking at good heartwarming moghulai food, then look no further MBH has all & more that you can desire... The restaurant in itself has a simple yet pleasant ambiance, but the food is exceptional & the staff go out of their way to make you feel at home... Only catch being, they really cater to office crowds, so expect a little longer waiting if you go in on a weekday for lunch.. else you can have the place all to your self :-)!! In summary, A must try & I'm certainly going to be back!!! An Amazing Indian Authentic Food With Good Service ! Good Experience ! Cheap Rates And Quality Food ! What else do you Need !! This was my first time visiting this restaurant - and was served with great food and service! The price is reasonably cheaper than other Indian restaurants and the taste is very good too! Will visit again soon 😊 we live close from this restaurant and almost every week end we order food. We've never been disappointed: food is excellent, a lot of choice, very good quality/price ratio. Best Indian and Chinese food in KL with normal price. Nice place for family and couples. Good staff . Had lunch hear as it was just round the corner from the hotel. The food was excellent, we both had the south Indian thali. All the curries we're very good and had a nice level of spice. Staff were very friendly and the AC was nice and cold. Excellent value at 13rm for a meal. My biryani place is tucked in at KL Trillion along Jalan Tun Razak which is a walking distance from Intermark. Tastiest biryani ive tasted in KL, fluffy rice, tender mutton, spicy accompanied with a nutty flavour curry and light raita.. Had eaten 3 times, i can say the flavor is very consistent.. Tandoori is a bit in the dry side, while the naan, light, soft.. personal fav - paneer kofta, big, soft curd balls in a lightly spiced, nutty, thick curry.. The price however doesn't make sense at all..all these good food, while in KL City Centre but it is priced so cheapp..i personally hope this shop will never be well known so that they could maintain their quality, and price and it wont be full with people, but i know its not right thing to do.. Had chicken briyani for dinner and it was delicious. Nice fluffy basmati rice and properly spiced and season. Will be back to eat more especially the curries. I was staying in Double Tree in KL and this place was just walking distance away. So bought Veg and Chicken biryani. Both were awesome. Considering the cost I was paying for Indian food other places, prices for Biryani is very reasonable. After having lunch, I actually packed for my airport transit as well. If you are in that area and looking for good Indian food, I would recommend this place.",4.5,20,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Try to get several entree from the menu since they all are inexpensive. They are all written in english and it explains how they cook it . Beers are expensive, one can cost as much as your meal but it will be worth getting one( about 4-5 US dollars. Having made numerous visits to Tiger Jit, I can say that consistency is definitely their strong point. Have never been disappointed with the fare offered here, always delivered with the same quality I’ve come to expect. Nestled in a corner junction along Jalan San Peng just opposite the Pudu LRT Station, the appearance is unassuming and bears a comfortable homely feel to the setup. An air-conditioned room is available adjacent to the main dining area, for those wanting to escape the KL heat. Personal favorites are the freshly made- to-order aloo prontha and chapatti, served with mutton curry, sardine curry, stuffed bitter gourd and a myriad of vegetables and gravies to match. Nice variety of chicken, fish, vegetables, egg and tofu are available, whether with rice or breads. Look out for the pumpkin dish, available only on Fridays. Taste has always been on point, and service prompt and fuss-free, even during the busier hours of the day. Prices are reasonable, some may say it’s slightly pricy, but I believe you always get what you pay for. A generous meal for 3pax with drinks can be had for below RM40, definitely worthwhile in my books. Tiger Jit will continue to be my go-to place for good Punjabi food, as long as it keeps its level of consistency as it has for the last 30+ years of existence. We were here this morning around 930am but the famed stuffed bittergourds were not ready yet. First few bites of the plain chapati I felt ""meh"" the ones at my fav shops in Singapore are still better. But as I then dipped into the sardine curry and dhal, I just couldn't stop. The combination was just delicious. We will surely be back again. Had lunch at this place last week with 4 friends. The chapatis were soft and fluffy. The curries that accompany the chapati are delicious - very authentic Punjabi curries. We also ordered 1 round of tea for all 5 of us and 2 plates of curried mutton (limited portion), 2 plates of curried chicken (limited portion), 1 mashed spinach dish (very small plate) and 2 pieces of stuffed bitter gourd. In terms of taste, the food tasted delicious. In terms of price, it's a little on the up side. The whole meal cost us RM80 which translates to RM16 per head. Looks can be deceiving in terms of size and comfort of the restaurant. From the outside the whole place looks small and unassuming but believe me, it can house quite a number of customers. There are air-conditioned private rooms too. The Indonesian servers at the restaurant are a very pleasant lot. They are very helpful and attentive. The restaurant is located right at the entrance of the Pudu LRT station, on Jalan San Peng. All in all, a delightful & positive culinary experience.",4,19,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tiger Jit Singh Chapati Restaurant.jpg,,

Not very fancy, but food was served fairly fast, and the service was good. Was extremely cheap, 30USD for food and drink, for 7 persons. Been eating at Q-Bistro branch every now and then. Sometimes I ordered roti canai and sometimes I ordered their Fried Mamak Mee. When i had those Im having their Q-Bistro special chicken as well. It taste like Chicken Masala but it had its own taste that cant be describe. They are having a modern mamak environment setup and always clean their restaurant that makes you feel comfortable to dine-in. At night there gonna be full of people having ""Teh Tarik"" for their hangout session. Me and my friends had our ""buka puasa "" here. Its my first time being here. Recommended by my friends. We had variety of food. Maggi goreng, Chicken soup doraisamy, lamb beriyani, last but not least kari kepala ikan merah...its was superb... The price is reasonable and worth it. I will definitely come back and bring more friends..im totally happy with the food, service and the environment. Great and delicious especially when you mixed all curry in your plate, Sup kambing also not bad, good location at Tesco Damansara and just next to the curve, relaxing and good environment while having our dinner at the outside of the restaurant. We went a few times to the branch in Tesco Damansara. Place is kinda slow by morning, so you are better off to go by lunch time. We usually enjoy some Tandoori Chicken with Nan. Sometimes drinks come late. My wife likes it. Thats important for me. We both had ayam briyani, which was delicious, and came with poppadoms, a side of pickled vegetables, curry sauce and a nice piece of fried chicken. The food and drinks were excellent, the service good and prompt, and the place clean and spacious. It is a quality nasi kandar restaurant for sure, with a huge menu that I am looking forward to exploring further. It isn't a mamak though, from the point of view that our breakfast cost RM32, which while not expensive, is a lot more than you would pay in a normal breakfast shop. Well worth it though in my opinion. We passed ""Q Bistro"" and to have late lunch at other restaurant. However after awhile we finally stopped at Q Bistro. Checked the menu and was very happy with the variation of the food. From authentic Malay to Chinese and Western. All are affordable. We stopped in to have some Indian food. We have been past many times and the aromas eminating from this humble bistro enticed we knew we had to stop in for lunch. Conveniently located on the lover level of Sungei Wang near the Giant market, the variety of food on offer here in just astou ding. My children are quite particular when in comes to Indian cuisine so we played it safe for our first visit ordering 2 orders of butter chicken-one medium spicy, one mild and a daal recommended by the waite plus garlic naans. . Everything we had was delicious, the naans were the best we've had in any country weve eaten Indian cuisine in! My daal was so flavourful I couldn't get the kids to stop trying it. Both butter chickens were eaten until the serving dishes were clean with the comments being that the chicken was of high quality and super meaty, lots of chicken included in the dishes and the sauce not overly fatty as they had had in the past. We will definitely be heading back to try more dishes off their extensive menu. Thanks so much for your friendly service too! The food price and the food tastes itself are not matched at all. Totally disappointing and not worth the money.",3.5,26,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Good selection of Chetnad selection and must try Masala Tea. Taste of food both vegetarian and non vegetarian is good. We tried the both and we're satisfied. The service by the staff is good.  Have been to to Anjappar Indian Chettinaad restaurant every time i visit Kuala Lumpur. Authentic south Indian food is served there. Tasty and Neat. If you are a group travelling you need to book in advance for seats or will have to wait a long time.Its located in a walkable distance from KL sentral station. Serves delicious south indian veg/non-veg dishes. I tried chicken biryani, masala dosa, chetinnad chicken and loved each of them. The chicken was soft and tender. Very reasonable price as well. We tried Thali, mutton biryani, chicken biryani, chicken tikka masala The food was really tasty with the right amount of spice.This was our third visit to the place and we will surely visit again. Delicious food for cheap money!! Especially their briyani is fantastic. In the central of Little India in KL. Wonderful Chettinad food in here, with all wonderful spices and chillies. Briani, rice and curries. You name it! Had dinner twice in the short time we spent in KL. Very good service from the waiter I don't remember his name, but gentleman all the way doing his best (man in his 40's with a moustache). We'll meet again! Try the watermelon juice as well. We had been to this place for dinner, chicken soup and chilly chicken dishes taste was fantastic. My Son had enjoyed idli and dosa. We felt food quantity and quality was good. Overall this restaurant is good for lunch and dinner. I love going to this place especially for dinner (convenient to hang around after work time) with my husband or sometimes with my friends. We had ordered variety dishes and w always satisfy with what we get. Worth going many times. Most of the food is recommend especially mutton briyani and lassi. price is abit pricey but worth the price. Ate many times at Anjappar. They did not disappoint. Whether north Indian or South Indian food they delivered every time. Good tasting food and fast service. Ordered their mutton briyani and lassi.

You may choose your food and also choose your roti, adding ongons/chillis etc... Oh my gosh the best roti I had was here in the morning they were just making it and it was delicious with the dhal and curi it was amazing we came here later for dinner as well and this place did not disappoint us. The food is great and the staff is really friendly and funny. Another cheap street eats place that does exactly what it says on the tin. Fast food, inexpensive and fairly tasty. Ate here a few times and each time the service got worse...really disinterested waiter who would only grunt when asked questions and made no effort to serve/clean tables etc. But you get what you pay for. Two breakfasts and tea/coffee for just over a pound. Our Bread and Butter during 5 days stay in Pudu Area in KL..... Daal rise, Nasi Ayam gorang, roti chanae..... amazing and budgeted....... yummy too. I've dined here numerous times over several years visiting KL. Prices are very reasonable - a meal and fruit juice or tea for about 10-12 ringit. Seems to be popular with the locals too. They have a good selection of Indian & Malay food. My only issue is, like most Indian restaurants, menu items seem to be only available at certain times of the day - I haven't quite figured out the specifics of this. This restaurant was a few steps away from Hotel Transit where I was staying but never bothered to try the food there except on the last day when I had to take a parcel. We took a parcel of veg fried rice and it turned out to be quite good. It was tasty and spicy. It is a simple restaurant and prices are very reasonable. The fried rice cost only 4.50 Ringets and the quantity is enough for one person. Cheap but price does not mention properly. It's confusing for traveller becz inside is not organised. The stuffs are friendly and smiley. Food served quickly however it's sometimes hard to get their attention. I like to eat the naan bread here, it comes with a couple of curries to dip in. They have fresh fruit juice too. This place seems popular with the locals. About 10 ringit for a meal and a drink. Located really near to my hotel. Offers some good food with a good price in a large portion.

Food and service was awesome too! Please remember to make reservation before going as the new SOP were very well followed by the restaurant and staff. Do ask for signature dishes! Comfortable and cozy environment. Very friend and attentive service from the lady boss and her staffs. Strongly recommended for any occasion. Will definitely return for next visit. We turned up without a reservation this time. Apparently they were fully booked but staff informed us to wait for the next available table which just took us about 15 mins. Food is absolutely delicious especially the steam River Lobster. We had the steam fish before, so this time we go for the steam River Lobster with the lemon lime chili. Glad we had it. No dissapointment. Ohhhh....Please let the chef knows if you want to spice it up as they tone down the spiciness. Great environment. For couple dining, go for the tables at the balcony. A place which is irresistible beautiful with great sunset view across the lake. If you love nature dining try this place. Romantic dinner with great food and a full bar with cocktails, and great wines. Try their flowing noodles, The first nagashi somen behind the garden but remember to make a reservation during this time as they practice hygiene not to mix with others public. And follow by the main course in their Thai Kitchen which their specialty over the years. They have a great bar at their downstair Tepi Tasik bar fro after dinner drinks too. I have been to Samira twice for lunch with friends and family. It’s a delightful place to eat. Located in the middle of Sentul Park, it is a perfect place to escape the hustle and bustle of Kuala Lumpur with its tranquility. The food was delicious and we were served by attentive staffs with a smile. A few delicious dishes to try are mieng kam (vine leaves with softshell crabs), steamed sea bass, deep fried lemongrass chicken and river lobster. I was told that the ambiance of the place is even better in the evening especially during sunset. Will be back for sure. Was quite surprised that a place like this existed in the city. You'll actually forget that you're inside KL when having dinner. Food was really tasty with a good portion. My favourite was the Asian Bass steamed fish and the Tomyam soup.

For the first time, I wouldn't believe how crunchy the chicken is without being soggy even after some time! It was so delicious and we had our tummy filled. The bibimbap was good too, and the chicken with soy garlic is definitely worth a try. But it is slightly pricy if you want to look for a cheap meal. This place can get extremely busy at times so be prepared to queue up. However, it is worth the wait. The food is simply amazing. Tried almost everything on their menu and was never let down. The red pepper flavour chicken is quite spicy so avoid if you are not a fan of chilly/ spicy food. Simple dish. Delicious fried chicken especially the red hot chilli. Its spicy nd sweet and the same time. The rice is just nice and you can add egg and other ingredients as per menu. The meal comes with soup, nice clear soup. I suggest kyochon if you're looking for simple and quick bites. The day we decided to go to KyoChon restaurant for lunch the queue to get in was the shortest we had seen in a while. If you don't mind waiting the line does move slowly and it is worth the experience just to try the chicken and see why so many people dine there. After trying kyochon My Town Mall, I eat kyochon in Pavilion Mall. I recommend Black Pepper Chicken, tasty as hell. Must try. First time here. I love their something spicy chicken or it was something red pepper. It was my first time eating with glove on. Would definitely visit again when I'm in KL. Their chicken is soooo good. I have try 4 different type of chicken. My favourite was the spicy one (i forgot the name). It was my first time eating chicken with and glove. Well what an amazing experience it was tying Kyochon's signature Korean chicken!! We visited late evening so the service was good but I have seen how busy it gets during the day with queue's running out the restaurant and down the forecourt so this must say something about how good their food really is!! I highly recommend ordering the whole or half soy and garlic chicken which was mouth wateringly tasty with a really light batter or the red pepper chicken if you like your spice!! We had a selection and the variety of marinated chicken they offer is simply world class. A 5 star experience all in all, just try to visit at a less busier time if you don't want to wait. Don't know why people are complaining about it being busy, surely you can see that before you went in and usually means it's worth waiting for?! Anyway, well worth the short wait and the service was great. We tried three different types of chicken and each was delicious, our favourite was the Pepper and the Soy & Garlic options and the side dishes were also lovely. Plenty of food for a fair price and great drinks options, they even provide wet wipes and plastic gloves for easy clean-up. We would absolutely eat here again and recommend it, don't understand why so many people have given such harsh judgement!",3.5,134,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,
409,Mohd Yaseen Nasi Kandar,8.00 AM - 10.00 PM,"351, Jalan Tunku Abdul Rahman, Kuala Lumpur Malaysia",None,None,None,"The evening we arrived to Kuala Lumpur we went to this restaurantwhich was not far from our hotel. The restaurant is quite basic but the advantage is that all dishes are shown in the front of the restaurant. We ordered and then we received our order inside where we found a free table. I am not a curry person but my hubby is. This particular shop I love because I can have their ayam kicap/hitam which is very tasty and juicy. They have varieties of dishes to choose from like squid,prawn,beef and fish eggs. I have tried other nasi kandar but somehow I like this one. I found this restaurant because it is located near to the hotel I stayed. There is a queue outside the restaurant, and it’s not rarely found in other restaurants. They serve classic nasi kandar with rice. Whatever dishes you choose, they will add different spicy sources on it. There is no English menu, but the staff are friendly and helpful. Staff also don’t speak in English, that’s the only thing that make us confused. My lovely wife and I called into this popular restaurant for dinner one evening. It's a classic nasi kandar joint serving up an assortment of dishes with rice and curry sauce. Just join the queue of hungry locals, pick out what you fancy at the counter and then tuck in. We followed the classic mix of adding one meat dish and one vegetable dish to our rice but it's really a bit of a free for all with some people happily adding three or more meat dishes. Whatever you pick it'll be topped off with various spicy sauces. I had cuttlefish & okra while my wife had fried fish & cabbage. It was much nicer than it might sound, mainly because of the epic sauces! All for just RM21 too. Very yummy and very good value. If you're looking for a tasty local experience with no other tourists in sight then look no further! this restaurant is located at the main and easily accessible by bus or monorail. should you decide to self drive do expect parking problem.  Very delicious Nasi Kandar in KL after Penang.My Favourite dish Dark soy sauce chicken and Fried omelette.Must try their squid sotong and other Dish there.The price is affordable. Open late some nights, this has a wide range of cheap and cheerful INdian Muslim food, and also drinks. One of the main attraction for this restaurant is its squid egg (Telur Sotong). The other foods selections were tasty. The location was great as it right by roadside of Jalan Tunku Abdul Rahman. Parking was not a problem as there were ample parking spaces nearby (within walking distance to the restaurant). Overall a good nasi kandar restaurant.",4,61,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Fabulous dishes, with variety and wide ranging choices for different people. What an indulgence! I found this place purely by accident, and I swear it was my growling stomach and the wonderful smells of spices that lured me to this place. The food is glorious. G-L-O-R-I-O-U-S. The service is very good but it gets busy, so be patient. The atmosphere is just what I wanted -- to hang around locals and observe them and eavesdrop on their conversations. Love the Malaysian sing-song Ingeris. One of the most special things you come to Malaysia from halfway around the world is the food. And Ali's Food Corner is the joint you want to make your way to. I did, day after day, using Grab car (taxi). It is well worth it. Be sure, though, to get a seat under a ceiling fan. And carry some sugar-cubes for the spiciness of the food. Excellent food quality at a great price. 2 roti canais and a plate of steamed rice, choice of 2 curries with 1 sides of vegetables and a can of coke and large water was only 22.40MYR. Friendly staff and although the English level isn't great,if you smile and have patience and not get too cranky you'll be fine and rewarded with an excellent experience. I went here a couple of times and I really like it! I tried some different dishes and all were good! The favorite was roti with chicken and their mango juice! They are open 24/7 and there is an older man speaking pretty good english. Good wifi! Went there for supper and found out that there was no menu there, was actually prepared to pay more than usual. I order 2 Nasi Lemak(Coconut rice) and 2 Teh Tarik(Pulled Tea) and suprisingly the server asked for only lapan(8) ringgit. Been here a few times now. The nasi goreng is so good. The ice tea with milk is also very tasty . Canai so cheap and also surprisingly tasty. The service is also fast and efficient with the guys being very nice. Value is excellent . Won’t find anything in kl that’s this cheap and so good. Food is phenomenal. Ignore the sporadic cockroach and this place is a gem. This Place was close to our Hotel. It offers very good street food and Indian Food. Prices are also less compared to other places in KL. Thosai and roti canai are amazing. This place was near our hotel, just outside the city center but close to the times square shopping center. It was always busy and we visited maybe four or five times, coffees are great in the morning and the marinated tandoori chicken was excellent. They did not have an alcohol licence but when we asked they went to a nearby shop and bought some for us but hid it on the floor. Only one recommondation, but we took the risk and found a very tasty place here! For a cheap price. Staff is helpful.",4.5,24,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

The food is always of the same high, delicious standard. The staff are always extremely friendly, efficient and attentive to their customers' needs. One favourite lunching place. There you'll find your local favourite hawker's fare. Today's choice for me is Cantonese style beef kuay tiao, a flat rice noodles. Friends ordered Hainanese chicken rice and mee bandung. Grandma's dishes out hawker's fare noodles and set lunches. Good service on a reasonable busy lunchtime during RMC0, recovery Movement Control Order for COVID-19. Quite enjoyed my seafood char kueh tiau, stirred fried flat noodles. I was greeted with a good dose of aromatic CKT, sufficient ""wok"" heat. I visit Grandmama's at Intermark Mall almost every other week. I love coming here because the restaurant is cool and comfortable, the managers are very friendly, with a nice personal touch in their greetings and services, and of course, the food is good and the price is just right. I take away food for my parents all the time and they always enjoy their meal from Grandmama's. Went for brunch before shopping wanted some local style food in comfortable and clean surroundings. This is a chain doing reasonable restaurant priced local food well prepared good size portions with friendly and attentive staff. Food was well prepared and tasty and hot! A request for extra rice was quickly filled the chicken I had had too many bones for my liking but my friends assured me that was a local preference. If I was looking for a quick tasty lunch I would definitely go again the friendly staff checked all was ok with our meal several times and kept the table clear of empty plates etc. We had a good experience. The food choices were all said to be good. The service was pretty good. Make sure to ask for your check well in advance as it took a while for us. Cooking was pretty good. Since it is located inside The Intermark Mall, downtown KL, business will be good. Hopefully quality of cooking will be maintained.

Love their menu.My favourite there is the Nasi Kunyit and Curry Chicken (yellow glutinous rice).They also have the widest range of Malaysian cakes and desserts, including my favourite of kuih talam. Just one complaint that the portion is a little small.Big good choices of traditional Nyonya desserts that will satisfy your cravings. Green beans dessert is very rich with sago and tiny pieces of sweet potatoes @RM5.30 per bowl.Tour stopped at this location. Food was good and tasty. A wide variety of tastes and spiciness..some curry but not overdone.Went to empire nyonya colours for dinner after my daughter playground at 8.15pm.Had Nasi lemak rendang chicken, Ice kacang for my dessert. To be honest, the gula Melaka are not diluted as the gardens outlet which I normally patronise. Service are prompt and no hassle. Had a lot kuihs for take away too.Reasonable Malaysian nyonya food at shopping mall which will not burn your pocket. Portion are huge too. I was introduced to this place by a friend knowing that I love authentic Malaysian dishes and kuih. I was so happy to have tried the food here. Love the kuih and I ate at this place for the 3 days when I was in KL.Whenever i need to feel guilt-free, i drop into this restaurant and order the fruit rojak. Unlike in other kopitiams, Nyonya Colors' came in a large bowl where the cut fruits comprising guava, mango, sengkuang, pineapple and large slices of keropok were immersed in thick spicy gravy. You need to do some exploration by digging into the dish with your fork and emerging with a delightful rojak-drenched jambu, then to spear again for a sourish pineapple or cubes of senkuang. The keropok is the best i have tasted: crunchy and fresh (one hates it if a keropok 'masuk angin' or isnt fresh minus its crunchiness). End the meal with the hot tehtarik, and you come away feeling good because you just had a large bowl of Malaysian fruits for dinner instead of the usual fried stuff. My soul food.I met up with 2 friends here for coffee. You pick a table note down the number and place your order. It's pretty cheap. I paid just under 9 Rm including the 6% extra for a coffee and a cham. No wifi.",3.5,43,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Delicious...sedap!! Like it after 1st bite, one of their signature dish. If the Ayam percik is larger then best lah ;D Free wifi. Helpful staff. The wooden furnitures, and the general decor plays a role in giving this restaurant a ""kampung"" feel.Food is generally great. Service fast. Seating might be an issue and I'm not sure if they take reservations.Pricey though. Expect to spend about RM50 (most likely more) for lunch/dinner for two.Tried their nasi dagang, nasi lemak and nasi kerabu. Portion quite big for 1 pax. Serving is quite fast but the food is a little bit pricey.Marvelous food. A bit hot but all is well.. And ample tissues to blow ur nose. Must try the nasi kerabu with beef and asam pedas Ikan... Moody moody and bandrex are drinks much different from anywhere..Try this restaurant as per recomended by friends, the food was very tasteful and service was very great. Love the Kerabu rice!!!I love this place. The decor is cosy, the manager of the restaurant is friendly, good service from the staffs & most importantly, tasty local cuisine. I love the fragrant kerabu rice.Belanga Cafe serve some pretty amazing Kelantan Malay cuisines such as Ayam Percik, Nasi Tumpang, Nasi Dagang, and Nasi Kerabu. I have eaten there many times, and have never had anything less than an excellent meal. It's worth stopping by if in the area.Fairly authentic Kelantan food. Delicious, flavourful and generous portions. A lot of choice. Enjoyed the roti jala, ayam percik and nasi lemak, with young coconut juice. For lunch suggest arriving before lunch hour office crowd. If ordering something which needs preparation, it may take longer than ordering something available at the counter, for example, satay (which is not kajang style but relies on the excellent sauce instead).",3,15,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

You could also choose to order some other dishes from the menu.Prices were reasonable and the lemon honey tea was quite the right drink to end with after dinner.Good food. The only halal sushi place that i know besides Empire Sushi @IOI City Mall Putrajaya.Best to lunch/ dine with a friend/ family members. Otherwise theres always a seating area for those who came alone.Love the mixed bento set, australian beef menu & matcha icecream.I always love Sushi King and this is also one of their nice tasty sushi branch with affordable food.Went to the one at Berjaya Times Square. Located near the theme park, 5th floor.Went at 845pm, closes at 10pm. Quiet, clean, staff ready to assist and friendly. Press the button by the side wall to call for bill or orders.Good selection of halal food, from bentos, tempuras, varieties of sushi (gunkan, nigiri, maki). Have a look through their online menu for an idea! Prices are affordable. You can order the sushi or pick them off the conveyor belt, no price differences.They have a lot more stores in KL, so do look through their website! Spent about RM60 for the items in my pictures!This halal Japanese restaurant feature a conveying belt sushi system. We tried the sushi on the belt and also the bento sets. Both tasted great. Recommended.I love eating here as the foods are affordable compare to other japan restaurant. I simply love the quiet space to eat and enjoy my meals.It used to be limited in sushi selection while freshness wasn't preserved so well in the past at other sushi king outlets. I notice business suffered significantly in the recent years when new sushi places opened. But this outlet in sunway putra mall is quite new. Service was surprisingly good though a little slow due to the weekend crowd. But sushi was fresh and the chinese new year mini bento was a novelty. It was served with a mini yeesang.

I on the other hand had a Waffle Burger :D . How should I describe the taste, the beef pattie by itself was nicely done, I had mine medium well, meaty but soft, the way i like my burgers..the waffles was really nice, by itself, together they were hard to descibe, I wouldnt say lousy because it wasnt, I wouldnt say delicious either because together it wasnt..the right word would be mixed feelings. But I will be making trip there to hv waffles one of these days, theyre really not bad.Somehow never made it there myself even though my wife ate here 2 years ago and said her spaghetti vongole was great. We started with pretty goo scallops.I had a better than decent filet mignon with veg and mashed potato, my wife had very delicious ""juicy Parmesan prawns"" and my daughter had the best chicken nachos I have ever eaten (she did offer!) (normally RM15, but was free on an HSBC offer). RM200 including a Carlsberg, so pretty OK.We went to celebrate a birthday and booked a table ahead of time. We were ushered to a private room once we arrived and we felt it was a lovely gesture. As I had been to this restaurant the month before, I wanted my family to taste the food which I enjoyed earlier. The winners were the Mushroom Salad - warm, crispy pieces of battered mushrooms atop a bed of salad and a simple dressing. It was delicious and large enough to share with a couple of people. The scallop starter was also good. Do go for a bowl of the oxtail soup - a very 80's dish but delicious nonetheless. Two of the five mains we ordered stood out as clear winners and these were the grilled lamb and the Seafood Potpourri with Turmeric sauce which was absolutely delicious! The waiter was very pleasant and helpful too.Monte's restaurant in the Bangsar Shopping Centre has been a main stay for our family dinners and special occasions over the last decade. Our most recent visit was for dinner on Chinese New Year as we wanted a relaxed and quiet environment where we could chat, and enjoy a good western meal. The restaurant is quite spacious and has a number of private dining rooms for a special occasion or when you want more privacy.The menu focuses on each of the main meat groups, beef, poultry, seafood, as well as pasta meaning that you can always find a dish that you like. The restaurant also has a good selection of wines and spirits to help you enjoy your meal.

The menu is mostly based on Indian cooking with a mix of some western and local styles. We had meehoon goreng, nasi lemak with chicken, chaapati with dhal curry and sphagetti. Food taste and portion was very good. Service is not bad. The restaurant is quite small, so bookings is recommended. I would give the cakes a go, not really worth the calories as it was not that great. Went there with some friends. The food here is really good . My personal favourite is the mee goreng , Philly cheese steak sandwich. The spicy chicken penne is also good . The service in this place used to be excellent . I used to have my lunch there every Sunday without fail. Unfortunately some of the older waiters are not here anymore and the service has also gone down . If they could improve the service , it would really be excellent . If you want to go on weekends, best make a reservation as it gets crowded .Twice last week, first week December 2018, my friends and I decided to meet for a very late lunch or substantial tea.The outlet is located on the 2nd floor of Bangsar Village mall. Not too heavy footfall traffic, but it is able to attract a decent number of patrons. Definitely not the boisterous crowd type. Good place to have a chat, chinwag with friends.None of us ordered the oft written lamb biriyani, although most of us were tempted, admittedly. We decided to have chapati instead, with chicken curry. Delicious, opened up our palates for sweets.And we gorged on banana fritters with ice cream. 4 helpings !! Irresistible !! Thats 30 extra minutes on the treadmill.Overall, it was a most pleasant way to spend an afternoon. The wait staff were attentive but not intrusive. Maybe its the afternoon crowd, much more laid-back. I would recommend to drop by, its decent sized, not too small to feel crowded, nor its not too big to be left out. When the occasion demands it, Citrus is definitely one of top picks for a go to place.I have eaten here many times as the food is generally liked by my children,but this time I traveled solo.

The word maze on the wall was fun.Definitely recommended. Hope to try the burnt chocolate cake the next round.The food is just okay. I used the entertainer apps on 1 for 1 main Promotion before but when I came this time, they told me it's only applicable to pasta and salad started from Sept which I would not like any of those for my breakfast. They shouldn't simply change the terms. When the restaurant signed up for this, then they should stick to what they have promised. Will definitely NOT come back anymore.The ambient was good and the food was ok. Apparently the staff there wasnt happy when we used our Entertainer(buy 1 free 1) app when ordering. We were told that we could only order item from Salad & Pasta for the 1 for 1 promotion. The staff didnt even bother explain to us only when I asked as it is shown in my apps that I could order anything and get anything for free(of course I will pay for the food whichever price is higher), he told me that since 1st of September the terms has changed. Next time explain to your customers politely, we are your customers, if you dont want any apps to help your business or that apps makes you lost money, dont use it.

Almost every nook and corner, you'd find a cafe to kill your afternoon and to get your caffeine addiction fixed. The Green Terrace in TTDI is one of my favourite places to go because it houses a few eateries which I like - the now defunct Cocott, La Moon, and The Other Half.love the coffee varieties - from espresso to milk based coffee. I had the iced latte and pour over coffee... Prefer the latter as I can taste the characteristic of the coffee bean slowly. It just like whisky but drinking coffee instead.food is not your thing? But you need something sweet to go with your drink? Go for their cakes - I tried the burnt cheesecake and thought that it was pretty good.breakfast & brunch menu include 1) TOH baked eggs resembling onion soup with a pastry on top.. break it to reveal the piping hot ingredients inside; 2) Laksa Sarawak is their modern interpretation of this East Malaysia popular import but the soup was little (options to add extra for extras); 3) duck leg confit which was browned and served crispy with Au Jus to dip, potato au gratin, French bean, tomato concasse and thyme.As I work in the building opposite, I had been in this cafe for at least 3 times. The first few times were decent, service was alright and food was pretty good. However, nothing was so spectacular that I need to write a review on it. However, recently, the service had gotten rather poor and a friend of mine who wanted to use the entertainer application was glared at with disdain. After the meal, the waiter did not even thank us and was still really rude.I particularly enjoy the big breakfast set here; especially the duck bacon. Frankly, it was my first time being served duck bacon. A break for two will cost between RM60-90 easily with drinks.

We get to taste a real Malaysian sambal, as I personally a Nasi Lemak hunter would give a Thumb Up for their samabal, authentic spiciness plus with the crispy fried chicken.

Probably one of the best Nasi L I ever had. Service took a little while but no worries because it was made fresh to order.Service is a little slow but I realized that this was because the fried tumeric chicken was cooked to order and hence came crisp and hot. Well seasoned and worth the wsit. Sambal is spicy but fragrant with onion. Quite extensive menu with hainanese-influenced dishes, retro coffee shop deco. Thumbs up.Large portion of nasi lemak with chicken thigh. At a good price of RM 12.90. The chicken was so crispy and delicious. The indonesia fried duck was on offer. We had that too.

Original store at studio 5 then open subsidiary store nearby called zaini 2. Chicken satay a bit of fatty meat. I prefer beef satay. If you like more lean chiken satay can try store near damansa perdana.Being a satay fanatic, I frequently crave for satay. By far, this is the best in town if it's not Malaysia. Personally, I prefer this much over the renowned Satay Kajang. It's juicy, tender and tantalizing!Do check out the place earlier especially if you are into 'spare parts' aka internal organs as it's of limited stock and in high demand. The beef and lamb satay are highly recommended!Used to be the go-to place for street food satay. No longer. It is now average if not below average. Sad to see the decline of an iconic street stay establishment.Used to be the best stay place in Malaysia, as far as I am concerned have been there many many times over the last 20 years or so, unfortunately the last couple of times the satay was not as good, the peanut sauce limited and not as good as it used to be.One of the oldest and best satay places in Malaysia. Been going three for mano years and it is still stessa head of the rest.The satay is a bit pricey but the taste is better than Satay Haji Samuri Kajang (in my opinion). It is located at a local food stall. It is not a fancy place to dine. Usually attract local people and regular customer.This stall is sited within a larger and motley collection of stalls at the end of AKLEH. Had this Bone Steak Singapore. Delicious tak berhingat. I don't have to go to Singapore, this place has it all. Next visit, will try Rojak Asma @ Singapore. I managed to track down Zaini satay finally and drove there from Bukit Bintang. It was a good 20 mins drive based on evening KL traffic...it wasn't too bad. We found it alright but it was closed, so we just ate at the next stall. It turned out to be quite good too. I think it may be better to try the other outlets as this Ampang outlet seem a bit run down. It's not a restaurant per se but a make shift food center next to the road.

Go go and taste yourself ya.Their origin was some where in taman Wah yu selayang. Was a little too far out of my way until they set up one branch in Glenmarie Shah Alam. Quite skeptic at first until one day my craving for curry fish head suddenly struck. Gave it a try but was rather surprised as the old flavour still persist. Spicy, hot, sourish and sweet all at the same time danced on my taste buds that day. I think they will become our regular spot fir the needy few weeks until my craving are answered. If you are in the area please do come give it a try and pass your own judgement. The owner surely struck me as welcoming and extremely friendly. We enjoyed it hope you will too.Even though it has existed a long time already, could not remember whether came here before.Was there last weekend for breakfast. They serve fluffy roti canai, nasi lemak & fried mee hoon in the morning. You may have a variety of dish to add to your basic meal, ie., various type of curries with chicken, prawn, sotong and fish, fried chicken and many more. Curry fish head / curry fish and mantis prawn is a must try, my personal favorite.Yummy curry fish head but very pricey. To be fair, they are not stingy with the portion - they charge and also give loads of vege.The pappadam and sambal was served automatically without asking and there’s a charge for it.... Errr not very honest deal here?!Good selection of nasi kandar ranging from fish head curry, fried chicken to king prawn and mantis prawn. Good quality but I find it a bit pricey. Small portion of fish head curry good for 2-3 person is rm60. The kingp rawn is rm65 per pcs.The fish head curry I for me is 'refreshing' curry, it is not so heavy on the curry yet still very flavourful. Price wise, it is more reasonable for the type of food that they serve, last I came for two person was RM150++, since we had the fish head curry and a few other different dishes.The famous and delicious fish head curry in town.

Freshly baked bakeries, roti canai, nasi kerabu and many more. Recommended to come. My friends and 1 have a small occasion here last week. Mine is Penang char kuey teow which super tasty served with delish spicy shrimp, egg and chili pickles. Overall the food tastes good and the portion is quite big. Their teh tarik is tasty and creamy! Highly recommended! Outstanding service for breakfast lunch and Dinner . We had dietary requirements and allergies and they accommodated this . Being from Australia I was amazed there was a mixture of food for all to try . Pastries in the morning were so YUMMY.  Had breakfast here and i love the food. the halal Malay cooking was on point. They had roti canai and egg station outside the restaurant. they had a coffee machine for a nice freshly brewed coffee. Their teh tarik was very good too. staff was attentive and replenishes their food fast. the pastry was also delicious. truly satisfied. please include breakfast when booking :) Lovely food and very tasty. Varieties of food to choose. Helpful staff and a very concerned F&B manager. Good variety and choice of breakfast but hot food cold. So disappointing . Choice of eating inside or outside. it is always great to wake up to a good breakfast. PNB Darby has a good selection but not extensive. But what was available was very good. There is an open air area with water feature. Remember you are in the city center so this open air area was well built to shield you from the foot traffic. We stayed 3 nights at the hotel next door and had brekky each morning.. was great and relaxing, a bit noisy if you had to eat in the smoking area. The buffet breakfast is great here. A selection of Western and eastern breakfast staples where you can mix, match and blend your own fusions. Fun, fast, tasty .. and coffee is tolerable. Good selection of food and good ambiance. The place is not very crowded because it's quite roomy. Serve halal food. Food was made fresh, quite quickly. Service staff were above average and very kind. Willing to speak with you and made you feel very welcome. Try the watermelon juice and the lemon chicken. Staff are very willing to make special orders. The breakfast buffet was quite sumptuous and delicious.

The guys here are really friendly and seem to love striking up a conversation with foreigners, especially if you are a cricket loving nation. The food is absolutely spot on, we helped ourselves to an assortment of beef kheema (minced beef curry) vegetable curry, dhal, biryani rice and the crispiest and flavourful piping hot naans I have had to date. We are going back today for lunch! Just do it. This place was pretty good. They give you a plate and you point to what you want. If you want more you bring your plate back and they'll scoop up more of what you want. They must keep track of it somehow and the prices were super cheap. It's weird eating room temperature food but I really didn't mind it at all. The owner was pretty friendly as well. Beautiful food, reasonable prices and super-friendly owners and staff. I worked in the neighbourhood for close to a year and had my lunch at Shahjee's on three out of five days every week. Large buffet-type of presentation, but you only pay for what you take. Their naans and chapatis are an absolute must. Choice of white or briyani-rice. Many dishes with minced chicken, beef and mutton, grilled kebabs, a variety of vegetarian and chicken curries. Best time is 12.30 to 1pm. Later, the selection becomes quite limited (and honestly, also cold!). An excellent place not only for hotel-guests from next door, but as well for regulars... They have a variety of selection of food veg & non-veg both, nice & clean restaurant, specially the restaurant staff are quiet helpful.  Ate here a couple of times during our stay at Citrus Hotel (its next door). Curries are excellent and the naan breads are huge, service friendly and prices were great. Not really a bad thing to say about this restaurant. You can get really great food here at a good price. the service is really good and the food is amazing. Probably the best Tandoori we have ever eaten. The nasi goreng and many of the other dishes the beautiful Muslim woman cooks and the wonderful breads cooked fresh are awesome. we ate there a few times so i was allowed to watch the lady make my dinner learning how to cook a great dish - thankyou. Every thing was perfect and don't forget to try mango lasi and i always try to eat from their.the Spanish man on the counter is supportive. If you are looking for indian and Pakistani food and staying at Citrus Hotel, don't worry for your search. Just get out of the hotel, and there the Restoran Shahjee, where you can enjoy a good range of delicious food. Its like typical malay eateries where you pick what you want to eat and pay just for that (buffet but pay for what you eat). I like this concept. Tawa paratha is must try. Rest of items are average, and is cold. if they keep food warm, that will make it better than most of rest. Area is not great...not very clean. But its like a typical dhaba and that price you dont expect luxury anyway. Its place for regular food. Not to take your GF for dinner date. Staff does not know english, but they are very polite and try to serve you as per your expectation. Good Asian food, really cheap, not a fancy place but satisfying. Try their Naan, really super. We ate their almost every night and it costs around 20 MR for 3 with soft drinks.",4,16,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Highly recommend the pokebowl set menu that comes with one of the nutritious beverages that you can select. I tried the turmeric drink out of curiosity. It's definitely not one anyone can take as it's quite spicy with a kick! I highly recommend Lady Olivia though. The restaurant is half of the shop as organic foodstuff are sold by the shop on the other half. Service was average as we needed to attract the staff attention. Food were mainly organic. Had their Signature Nasi Lemak and Fresh Tropical Rojak which were quite ok. Normally they gave each a small free ginger drink but we did not get any this time. The restaurant area can be improved as vacated tables were not cleared on a timely basis. Healthy wholesome Asian dishes to eat. Plus a mini supermarket for healthy food items and beauty products. I ordered Veggie Nasi Lemak. I asked to have it not spicy but one of the cabbage and carrot mix was too spicey!! Also tried the moringa croquette and mane mushrooms. Both are good too but fried so avoid if dieting. My husband is a vegetarian and loves the vegetarian bak kut teh here. BMS has a lot of variety on their menu. I usually like to try out their noodle options. It is nice to have good healthy vegetarian options in a shopping mall. I got the chance to taste the soy milk curry laksa for lunch yesterday. It was soooo.. delicious! I would highly recommend this. Unfortunately, for the price of RM18.90/= I find it rather expensive. Maybe they could also add in more vegetables. Nonetheless, next visit I plan to try the nasi lemak they are famous for. Do ask for sambal to go with the laksa. Sambal is very tasty too. Good food, good service, and expensive store attached to the restaurant. We ordered Soy milk curry pot with multigrain rice, organic salad with passion fruit dressing, and sweep potato crunch. During our visit, the place offered a promotion – the 2nd Soy milk curry pot with multigrain rice was free!The Nasi Lemak was a pleasant surprise with the very fresh sambal (many other places now serves sambal that are a few days old), & the pumpkin Rendang served together with the nasi Lemak was very delicious.Downside was at RM 13.90, there were only 2 cubes of pumpkin. When I asked the supervisor, she answered that it is the standard portion. Hmm... when I looked at other bloggers photos of this dish, didn't find any that has less than 2 cubes! Tried the Soy Milk Curry Pot, & Fisherman's Harvest, all were delicious. Service could be improved by training the staff continuously. All 3 visits in the past 3 weeks, we had to ask for serviette. Some staff members were friendly, but seems like coming from their own friendly nature, they didn't seem to have much clue about customer service. With this observation + the small portions, in my opinion it is overall over-priced. Will still go back for the quality of the food though. Organic, the healthy mantra! BMS gives another choice of organic restaurant in fusion style. the menu has good choices, the prices are mid high. B1F1 is on now.",4,19,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Foods are okay but i cant eat with too many flies. The restaurant has moved to the new premises located at the end corner of the shops blow its gym. You can find all the kelantanese food under one roof but the prices are expensive. They have a selection of Kelantanese food like nasi dagang, nasi kerabu, grilled fish, laksa and an assortment of vegetables and ulam with sambal. The food is authentic, tasty and freshly prepared. Pricing can be high depending on your order. Good lunch crowds especially during week-ends. Many choices of local food mostly east coast delicacy. Some are : Nasi kerabu Nasi dagang Pekasan Laksam Roti canai Ikan bakar Sup tulang. This restaurant is quite popular for having variety types of local cuisine eg ikan bakar (grilled fish), lauk kampung (local dishes) , ulam (local salad), but terribly overpriced for a nasi campur (local mixed rice) restaurant. RM60 for 2 pax! and we only had 1 piece of grilled fish, 1 portion of ulam, and 1 portion of salted fish dish with gravy- all to share. With 1 bottle of mineral water (not even Evian!) and 1 teh o ais (ice tea). Food tasted very average, not bad but I've had better. But the price is so unreasonable. Not coming back. Good selection of Kelantanese foods that are freshly prepared. Good place for lunch and dinner. I won't go here for breakfast though...and will not order anything except for Nasi Campur. As for the price; I would say that it is pricey! The foods are delicious..authentic Kelantanese taste...but very pricey. What I like most are their ' nasi kerabu' and ' kueh akok'..really tasty and very original recepies used. To get parking space is very difficult during peak lunch hours so be there for early lunch. + A lot of variety of Kelantanese dishes, especially during lunch.  My personal favourite is ikan keli percik. Selection of nasi putih, nasi kerabu, nasi dagang, nasi lemak - with lots of lauk to choose from. Roti canai also available for breakfast. Delicious! My husband love to eat here because of the Keli Masak Lemak. This is the place to find all types of Kelantanese Delicacies. To me it is quite expensive on the prices but the food never let you down.Nasi kerabu and nasi dagang with a lot of lauk. Tasty. But beware, very expensive for a normal standard restaurant.

We were welcomed into a very stylish dining room and offered a special promotional cognac tasting - a great way to start and gave us time to get the feel of the place. You can see the chefs working away calmly supported by a team of wait staff going about their business in the dining area. We were taken to a table and before we realised what was happening, Chef Yogi was presenting the first of 11 courses from his vegetarian tasting menu. He didn't just present the food - but also the Ayurvedic principles that inspired the overall menu. The care that went into each dish was obvious from his descriptions and the thoughtfulness behind the whole experience was evident. The dishes were designed a) to look and taste great b) to surprise and c) to educate. We had chocolate ""quail egg"" with spiced oil spheres, mashed potato inspired by Robuchon but enhanced by India, inside-out tomato, re-imagined samosas. The menu changes quarterly so don't expect to see those items if you go there now. The wait staff are absolutely top notch. Food appeared and disappeared, napkins were folded, water was poured - all as if by magic. You never needed to look for a waiter - they were already there taking care of whatever it was. This isn't Indian food - it's Indian inspired but also draws on the chefs travels around the world. Great ideas, good food, fantastic service gave us the special occasion dinner we wanted. Flour rising has recently launched a take away menu to mark MCO 3.0. This menu is comfort food Indian, rather than their normal fine dining. We ordered Chicken in Butter Sauce, Mutton in Garlic Sauce and some Indian breads. To our surprise the we found some additional items with compliments of the chef. The ordering & payment process was hassle free. They don't except CC payments but offer multiple options for Online Bank transfers. the prices of dishes was extremely reasonable and decent portion size. The delivery arrived ""right on time"" for our dinner and as we stay close to the restaurant the food was still warm. But to mention the attention to detail there was a note attached to the take away bag which stated all the reheating instructions, so that one got the best of experience, taste and flavour of the Chefs Creation. As they say most books are judged by their cover. The packaging of the take away food was excellent, very well presented and everything fitted nicely in a deluxe upmarket paper carry bag. Thank you Chef and the Four team for caring for the environment. If you want class, elegance and very high staff and above all meet the best Modern Indian Cuisine in town made by the superlative Chef Yogesh Upadhyah, this is for you. Ambient very clean. Reservation Mandatory. No slippers, no casual dress. We had lunch here and were swayed by our experience. Service was nice and friendly and they were also accommodating to our requests to help us take photos. The decor is mostly in black and white and very modern and pleasing, nothing suggests that this is an Indian restaurant. The toilet is worth a visit even to wash your hands, luxuriously well and thoughtfully appointed. The food was nice and I do not think it was too little as many here commented on. We ordered naan, cottage cheese with tomato, King Prawns and briyani chicken to share. After our meal, we ordered masala tea which was served in a fancy and pretty teapot set with butterfly motifs. The tea was rich and creamy and so delicious. Love everything here and definitely want to be back soon.",4,134,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

The other dish was good and tasty (black pepper beef). Prices are acceptable and the ambient is good.We went there upon recommendation of a friend, the restaurant is in a mall. the food range in the menu was good and the price was a bit high but acceptable. The staff however were a bit rude and it didnt appear that they were going to put the extra effort to make it better for the customers. It took almost an hour for us to get our food. The food was good and tasty.Went to their branch at Setia Alam and after passing by the restaurant numerous times, we finally dropped in for dinner. This restaurant always have a long queue dinner time and understandably, the food is good and price is fair. A dish of noodles and rice with meat and sides costs an average RM12-15.We ordered Nyonya Seafood Noodles, Jawanese Noodles, Beef satay, Ramen with Fried chicken and egg, cendol and bubur cha cha.Bill came at RM72.60(Rm6.50 gst) for 3 people.The Nyonya Seafood noodles soup is almost similar to tomyum flavour. Slightly spicy with lots of yellow noodles.Jawanese Noodles dish is huge too and the curry delicious. Ramen was nice except that I think the soaked fried chicken doesn't go too well with the dish. Chicken cooked any other way: steam,boil,grill but not fried. It makes the chicken tastes soggy.The cendol and bubur chacha is nice too, not too sweet. They serve banana in their bubur chacha , a Nyonya tradition way of serving bubur chacha.Of all the dishes, the beef satay is a disappointment. It costs RM12.60 with very little meat. There's a layer of fat in the middle which some of us on't eat and that left us with not much lean meat.The satay sauce is nicely fragrant.Yeah, if the satays come in chunky, it would be perfect.The staffs are very attentive and work together as a team during peak hours.Well done!Located at the Pavilion, this nyonya restaurant serves nyonya cuisine as well as international fare like spaghetti, Japanese ramen, Bratwurst sausages and tomyam on the menu so don't expect the most authentic meal here. It does however provide a convenient and reasonably priced food for the working crowd. Food is mediocre at best but acceptable. Service however badly needs improvement.Don't expect too much on service. Extremely packed during lunch hours. But that aside, the taste of food is great especially the curry fish head.

Very accommodating staff. nice ambiance. I loved their food with the amazing sauces,it was the first restaurant i had tried in Malaysia and it was a nice experience although i think the meals were slight tiny and pricy but you have to tray this restaurant at least for one time. The service was pretty slow and they ran out of 2 things that I ordered. I used to work in Nandos in England so I know this can happen. The staff were friendly though, and there was one guy who kept singing “welcome to Nandos” seemed he enjoyed being there, gave a good vibe. Food was yummy though! my friend told me that i shud go to this resto, spicy and chicken is my favorite one... so i went there for dinner with my daughter. she ordered burger with french fries... taste is so great, me ordered a new menu which is not really like it but it was okay. the ambience is good, they serve well and friendly. We came as 6 people. 2 adults, 3 teenageers, and 1 children. We order that peri-peri 4 portion and other stuffs. I kinda forgot. But the ayam is so nice 😂 Will come back for sure hehe Great treat, feasting on tongue kicking,licious finger licking PERi-PERi flame grilled chicken. From the PERi-ometer, we chose the HOT heat. Totally fabulous, satisfying. Besides chicken, we also ordered hummus with PERi-PERi drizzle. For warming up, we had the totally delicious PERi-PERi soup, served with a fresh garlic roll. Tasty peri peri chicken and very delicious cold apple juice. also we tried Espadeta and peri peri chips. well designed ,tasty cocked and unforgettable. Nice upscale place with great sauces to choose.

What else can you say about chicken?After busy day sightseeing and just as it started to pour with rain what do you need....cheeky nandos!!!!! Exactly same as uk so you know what to expect, tasty food and friendly staff. Had to be done. Awesome grilled chicken with tourist friendly price.

I choose package which is roasted chicken, boiled and tofu braised, pakchoy, soup, rice and drink just slightly RM. 20 per package. RM. 20 you can get this inside the shopping mall. They also accept credit card. Bravo! The food is nice and quite satisfying. It’s a lot like home cooked food so doesn’t leave you feeling like you’ve eaten a big unhealthy meal outside. We stopped into the chicken rice shop at Avenue K for lunch. The seating was nice with a good view of the mall. The food we had was very good, the service was prompt and attentive and the prices were fair. We shared a chicken rice, I had the curry laksa, and my wife had the honey BBQ chicken with noodles. Everything tasted great. Those along with an ice tea for my wife and water for me cost 38 MYR. We would go back, but not an exciting place - just good. This is one of my favourite stops for a leisurely tea in Kuala Lumpur. When I am near 'The Chicken Rice Shop' anywhere just before 3pm (available 3pm-6pm on weekdays), I make my way there for a fabulous treat that is served with coffee or tea. Imagine for about RM7.00 you have a choice of three sets of different combinations of pai tee, chicken, spring rolls or roti canai. All tasty and satisfying! We were able to tasted the RM 1.90 1/4 steamed chicken and its so delicious. Even my kids love it. Every 18th of the month they have a promo of RM 1.90 1/4 steamed chicken.

The thing i love the most about it was the chicken . It had a strong taste and was delicious. It was definitely worth my time . Located in Level G3 Publika, Solaris Dutamas, this restaurant is easy to find. However, the aroma when you entered the site is a bit smokey. Perhaps it is no wonder since the restaurant serves direct cooking in front of customers' tables. The staff will greet you immediately and bring you to the available table. I noticed that the big boss himself served cooking for us. He will do so to other tables as well whenever he has time. For those of you who like Korean foods and wanna share it with friends or families, this option is the best one. But if you are a small eater, please carefully consider to share the 2 Pax portion with 4 people. The 2 Pax Dakgalbi costs about RM66. The foods are fresh and a lot. I would recommend to go with Dakgalbi then can add rice cake or cheese rice cake, octopus, and mushroom. The good thing is the restaurant provide cold drinking water in a jar for each table so you don't need to order more drink if you don't want to. Since the food is a bit spicy, I will recommend to have drink like iced honey aloe to sooth your stomach. Lovely nice people and nice food also.there have a cheese ring that will make u feel like never want to stop.and im not a korean food favourite.but while im eating this is not bad and nice... I love the food, the sauce they used to cook it's delicious. The starters (also nice) are refillable but self service. I like to add Udon to my Chicken set. One set is enough for two person actually. Only thing would like them to change is from giving Tentacles to Squid body part. I hate tentacles. We couldn't decide where to have dinner that night so we just walked around and checked out all the restaurants at Soho. The aroma of cooking at this restaurant made us salivate. We wanted to sit at the alfresco seating outside and enjoy the cool night air but were told that no cooking is allowed there as there have been complaints from the neighbour. We sat inside the restaurant and ordered a chicken dakgalbi and a seafood pajeon. The food was cooked at our table by the servers. It was interesting watching our food being cooked while the aroma wafted up. They serve some side dishes or banchan of soup, pickled white cabbage and kimchi with the meal. We were pleasantly surprised that the food tasted so good. The pajeon we ordered was also very tasty. We have no complaints with the server cooking our meal nor the service at this restaurant. Pricing was reasonable and we enjoyed our dinner very much. If there are any complaints, it was the smell of cooking that stuck to us and our clothes. An enjoyable meal we hope to repeat. My second visit to the place. Serving are satisfying. Love the Cheese RIng. Waiters are very friendly. Offered us a fan as it can get pretty hot having it cook right in front of us. They also recommended the must try from the menu. The food was good albeit a bit stingy for the price paid, but the servers really had to be trained to smile or at least show a less grumpy face. Getting their attention to replenish the fresh vegetables was also a challenge as they tend to avoid your eyes. The cheese ring was only 1/4 full, so it was not a good deal and the taste a little too bland. My son suggested that we bring our own tasty cheese the next time we eat there so that there is enough to go around. We opted to have 2 ramen and 1 rice instead of 1 ramen and 2 rice which was the right choice as the ramen is really springy and tasty.",4,60,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,
432,Meals Station,8.00 AM - 8.00 PM,"No 1, Level 8 KL Sentral Station, Kuala Lumpur Malaysia",None,http://mealsstation.com.my/,None,"Kopitiam or coffee shop is one good place for traditional Malaysian style breakfast. Other than Old town white coffee and Paparich, Meal Station is one popular in klang valley. Price wise is more affordable compare to the 2. Varieties wise also. The sambal toast is one best sandwich must try here. New recipe fried nasi lemak taste so good as well. This restaurant is one of the many restaurants housed on the same floor of the Inter Mark Mall. Very convenient to order other dishes of your choice from any other restaurants. Nothing special here but can enjoy nice coffee. Friendly staff and clean outlet. Our family members had good dishes from their choices at these outlets. Ordered a couple of soups along with sandwiches and soda. Nothing special, but a clean and cheap eat at the KL Sentral.  Valuable and good location. I always choose here for quick lunch when I pass by. Easy to try new food because they are so reasonable and staffs are nice too. They sell some packed Malay sweets at cashier but I haven't try them yet and look forward to do. A place worth trying when you ar at kl sentral waiting for trains or buses... they serve decent local set lunches and fast service.. Recommended is their mee rebus & nasi lemak ayam goreng... Was there for lunch with company staffs. the food there is alright , nothing really fanciful and nothing really great. I had ordered the egg on toast.the toast totally melt in mouth.so amazing.staff very helpful and polite.will come again to try the other dish. A cafe in the station, I know what you're thinking, but this place is great, tucked away on the LG floor and as far as I can see only used by the locals. The food here is typically Malay fair & mostly for breakfast, cheap easy to order and very tasty a light breakfast of steamed bread toast & eggs to the more filling Nasi Lamak or chicken & rice. A convenient place to have rice served with vegetarian curry. The curry consists of natural food made of cabbage, potatoes, long beans and tofu. There are three more vegetarian dishes in the Vegetarian Corner list, namely vegetarian sweet sour chicken with rice, vegetarian curry mutton and vegetarian club sandwich. It’s a chain. Fast food. Not your typical fast food, but fast food nonetheless. And deceptive. As a vegetarian, I am aware there is a risk in eating some foods with sauces and broths that you (and often eh employees) don’t know if it meat based. Meals Station has a broad array of Asian and Indian influenced dishes that they churn out en mass at a cheap price. And the foot traffic suggests it was a good place to get some “local” food cheap. Plenty of pork, beef and chicken options, curries, broths, noodles. Fresh fruit juices, smoothies. They even had a vegetarian section, albeit small, on their menu. So I took a chance on what was an oxymoron. There was a vegetarian curry mutton. I know, I know, I know, I should have asked. I could have asked. But I didn’t I trusted. And, as ai figured, I was right and wrong. It was not vegetarian. I got a bowl of meat in what was actually a very curry curry sauce and a pile of rice. I can only imagine their other vegetarian options, of which there were four. So, buyers beware. Looks are deceiving and they take creative liberties with how they define and label their food!!!",3,32,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

You can see that it has been well loved, we had the Nasi Lemak which was good. The drinks were refreshing with an Iced Milo or the Iced Lemon Tea. We arrived around 3:30pm and were super lucky as we received the last two portions of Nasi Lemak. It was so nice and probably the best Nasi Lemak I have tasted (but I only have a few references tbh). The staff are super friendly and so quick. I think we had our food within 3 minutes of ordering. We both thought it was delicious and would have returned if we’d been back in the area. very nice nasi lemak with chicken...good service...n a good old days environment...they hv oso choices eg toast bread with butter...fried meehoon...n chicken chop. located close to central market n there are two floors. during lunchtime there will normally be big crowd ...and especially when it rains. This cafe looks like a very old cafe but the foods that are served is very delicious. We went here for breakfast and ordered nasi lemak, breakfast set and kaya toast set. They served very fast. It tasted delicious. This restaurant was restored not so long ago and attracts a lot of locals who work in the area. The food is average to good, but there is something in the overall ambience which I find attractive, a positive sort of vibe. Perhaps it is the legacy and the story of this beautiful building. As a KL native, I do hope that the authorities, owners and bodies such as Think City will incentivise such restoration efforts. This halal cafe inherited the old Sin Seng Nam genes which dates back to 1928. The Choong family no longer manages the famous chicken rice stall, and even the foreign workers who took over in 2014 have left. The reason could be because the latter would chop up the chickens by 9am in anticipation of the lunch crowd! Today I ordered mee rebus sotong telur for RM6. It was garnished with fritters, taufu, whole hard boiled egg, half a lime and sliced green chilli. The gravy is a mild spicy potato sauce. (The only other place that I know that offers the potato gravy is a stall alongside Yut Kee, off Jalan Dang Wangi, but I inevitably suffer from diarrhoea whenever I succumbed to the temptation to eat there!). In this cafe, the chicken chop is now served with brown mushroom sauce instead of tomato base sauce in the old days. Customers also order the hailam coffee, nasi lemak, kaya toast and chee cheong fun. The wall is decorated with blown up prints of old photos of market square and the surroundings. Visit for the nostalgia. we always drop by here to eat the popular menu there like chicken chop and yong tau foo or even mee hun hailam! one of our fav spot to eat here.. and old cafe in town that offer a variety of food. this cafe formerly known as sin seng nam cafe, located in Medan Pasar, Lebuh Ampang, Kuala Lumpur. To be more accurate its located at Dataran Medan Pasar, Lebuh Ampang. Its a cosy cafe literally a kopitiam concept. Quite a good place to enjoy your meals especially for lunch with buddies and colleagues. Here, you will see a hawker-style under one roof. There is a Nasi Lemak kiosk, Yong Tau Foo or some call as Chee Cheong Fun, Mamak Rojak/Mee Rebus and many others to explore . How to get here? It is easy if you familiar with Masjid Jamek area or Medan Pasar, Lebuh Ampang. Just across the road if you come from Pasar Seni (Central Market)/Cititel Express Hotel. Item you should try here is the famous ""nasi lemak ayam"" basically rice cooked with coconut milk with ginger and pandan leaves to make it taste and smells good. there might be other ingridients but basically thats the major thing to use. Then it served with peanuts, fried anchovies, slices of cucumber, and the spicy sauce called sambal. You may also find other good Nasi Lemak in any other places around Kuala Lumpur. But this one is worth to try if you have no issue about the price. Everything is hike up nowadays. Only tears and rain falls down . A plate of Nasi Lemak with whole-leg fried chicken and a sunny side up cost you about MYR14.00. well, its worth to pay for what you will get and enjoy. Other things like Yong Tau Foo is subject to item you choose to have, roughly it will cost you from MYR10.00 to MYR14.00 depending on how many item you take. with that price you can even share for two at least. no question if you really a good foodie. And yes, the signature chicken chop is a must try, tho I'm only stuck and addicted to the Nasi Lemak and Yong Tau Foo. Most of the visitors give a good recommendation for thier Chicken Chop menu. Have a try! Come with your colleague, buddies, partner or maybe family. Enjoy their foods and chit chats. Good place to sit by and have a coffee and cake, with nice interior and setting all white with good atmosphere.",4,24,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

This is a good Chinese restaurant in KLCC on the top floor. They feature live seafood tanks so you can't get much fresher. Tasty fresh dishes. Good place to eat for a no-pork served restaurant. The quality of food still can maintain, while services is not bad as well.Nice Chinese restaurant located on the top floor of the mall. Went to this restaurant on a couple of occasions for a Dim Sum lunch. A good varied choice of Dim Sum which was very tasty with good sized portions, in fact ordered too much every time. Really enjoyed this place, good service and good Dim Sum.very yummy and delectable Chinese dishes with matching cozy but spacious ambience. The dishes are supposed to be good for 2, but the actual servings are quite big and maybe good for 3 or 4 for small individuals.I went there with my girlfriend with a craving for dimsum and dumplings and we were not desapointed, great number of choices but a littlebit too small plates and a long wait.Due to its location in KLCC, many people thinks this place is fine dining with expensive food kind of restaurant. Actually it is quite reasonably priced, especially the buffet dim sum with its variety of menu. Location is great, service is fast, It is good for both business and family dining. In Aug-Sep, I always wait for their arrays of Halal Moon Cake for sale, which I believe is one of the most popular choice in town.Excellent place to meet for business dim sum lunch - great ambience and great food.

After saying that we wanted a table near the window, the waiter did what he could to move us there when the seat became available. The list of vegetarian options on the menu was extensive - unusual for Malaysia based on previous experiences - and it was difficult to choose what to have as there was so much choice! Vegetarian fajitas were delicious, as was my mojito. It was packed and had a really good atmosphere to it. We were served relatively quickly and food didn’t take too long either.If anyone tells you you can’t change the flavour of the drummettes in your Triple Dipper, they’re lying to you. Some staff are really nonchalant & will not offer satisfactory service, but most are great! Especially Syafiq! Good on you You really made my family’s dinner a better experience.The first time I visited this restaurant with my family back in 2010 when I was 15 years old. We ordered delicious food and the waiter was a friendly boy. I had a great time with my family. I really love this restaurant it’s not because of the food was amazing or other reason, I love this place because it reminds me of my family. It’s like my home. This is a great place for family gathering and it creates a great family bonding moment. Today my family is not with me. Whenever I visited this place alone , I would like to eat in this memorable restaurant. Overall, I’m very happy. I’d like to take this place with my children in the future. Lots of love , Angelous Sagun. ♥️♥️♥️♥️I had lunch here on a Saturday afternoon about 3:00 and the wait for a single table was 10-15 minutes which is not too bad. I've eaten here before at a normal lunch hour and also at dinner and the wait is normally much longer. Since I was alone I ate at the bar and was seated immediately. The food was almost exactly like the Chili's in the US so it was a nice treat after being in Asia for several weeks.The staff really are amazing, even though you see them scurrying about during the peak dinner shift. We didn’t have to wait too long for a table also probably 10-15.No complaints about the food and felt that the portions were rather large. The price point is also great!

I and my sister had our lunch there yesterday afternoon. Good varieties of Malaysian & Padang dishes at reasonable price. Very friendly and helpful staff, cozy environment. Just fish and chicken dishes alone, there were so many ways of cooking, how I wish my stomach had room to stuff all. Bought four vouchers through fave for 40 bucks per adult. The setback - were seated outside the dining area which quite far from the serving area. Quite hot outside compared to proper aircon inside. Please make sure your reservation is placed inside the dining area otherwise it won't be a memorable and nice experience. We personally did not enjoy and wouldn't repeat. Couldn't enjoy the food. Would rather recommend Putrajaya International Convention Center. In Ramadhan, this restaurant offer Ramadhan buffet at regular price RM99, but you can find promotion voucher online and you can get RM70 voucher. Here you can eat various and nice food and desert, Air Zamzam also available. Have indoor parking, elevator, escalator, surau (they also ready for tarawih). Cozy place to coz they arrange the table not to pack.Had their buffet lunch. They have a modest selection of mainly malay food, which were quite tasty, especially their satay.We had our family gathering hi tea here, after a short tahlil (recites quran) remembering our late mother passed away 10years ago. The parking was very much convenient, the buffet spread wass so varied dat 12-4 seems short to try out everything (read we gonna come back dor laksa) and the ballon guy was very much kids-entertaining. It was all good about this place. Surely will repeat.Halia restaurants is the best value of your money for Buffet Lunch or Dinner in KL or Selangor.We experienced our very 1st malaysian hi tea atvtgis reastaurant and we were so amazed by the spread we had seen.. we over ate that day it was beautiful delicious and worth the trip to sime darby centre as it is a little out from normal touristy places.

They serve ala carte buffet and also dim sum ala carte buffet.delicious taste and cheap.will dine there again in this month.free parking as well. The BBQ lamb are slight burn while the prawn are undercooked, satay was the star of the night and desserts is nice,I love the coffee the most,overall the buffet are OK.Went for buffet dinner using Groupon which is about half the price. Food variety was pretty good with many type of dishes especially dessert. The taste were quite decent for some but others were so-so. Food is replenished quite often and there were no shortage during the while time. Waiters were efficient too. Only drawback was there were flies around and on the food especially the appetizers as they are not covered.",3,28,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Staffs over there are very friendly and quick response. Talking about the food , it's very delicious. Clean n safe environment. Large portions, good variety. Googling for the phone number was a failure coz it's incorrect! The place is slightly difficult to find as it's in a relatively hidden corner in the shopping mall so if you have friends from overseas (like I did!), make sure they have good directions.A tantalising local menu with fusion twists and very good prices - service is fast, atmosphere is a-buzz with conversation and the food is delicious and beautifully presented. A must-visit. One of my favourite lunch place near KL Sentral. Previously at Sooka, have moved to NU Sentral (near F.O.S., same row as Paparich). This place is usually busy with lunch crowds on weekdays, but plenty of seats and suitable for group lunches. Always difficult to decide which meal to go for as there are many delightful and delicious choices available. The Nasi goreng kampung and Ayam percik rice dishes or herb marinated roast chicken are my recommendation. Well managed joint. I noticed the lady owner is around most of my visit, servicing customers with her staff. She would promptly attend to waiting customers, personally clean up tables and ensure customers are attended to. Great lunch with great foods and reasonable price.This restaurant suitable for colleagues, friends, family gathering.Foods in Chili Espresso at the quite recent launched Nexus at Bangsar South (Kuala Lumpur) are delicious. Pizza is my favourite and I really like their grilled vegetables pizza. We also tried their Penang Fried Kuey Teow and it's equally tasty.i have a regular customer at chili espresso for a long while. the food is always consistently good at reasonable prices with very good service. due to great quality of food i remained a regular customer. food: the nasi kerabu is a favourite among my friends. The western selection is where the restaurant hits its stride. the seafood marinara is spicy and sweet. the italiano burger is moist and ever so good with pesto sauce. the chicken chop and roasted chop has beautiful roasted vegetables and an excellent sauce. The beef sandwich is also very good and moist. my only complaint is that the drinks could be better as it does not match the high quality of the food.",3.5,23,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

The food is consistently good, and priced reasonably.I visited here on the Friday night but the restaurant was almost empty. It is not because the restaurant is not popular but maybe it was too early for the dinner time. So if you prefer to have dinner in quiet time, you should go there 20:00 pm at the latest.Staffs were friendly and gave me a detailed explanation for each menu so that I can choose my favourites.Clean and cool good service. Kurma Curry Chicken, fried fish and banana leaf are tasty and nice. The young coconuts went well with our lunch. A lot of crowd during lunch time but plenty of seats available. Its a big restaurant.Most amazing indian food great service and very good prices, the mutton curry is the best curry i have eaten in a long time. This is typical KL banana leaf restaurant. The food is ok. We always enjoyed the service. Price is cheap like any other banana leaf. Overall good for occasional visits and snacks. You will get Idly, Dosa, Samosa as well as South Indian Thali.Located right behind the Bangsar LRT, it is more convenient to get here by public transport as parking may be a bit of a hassle, especially in Bangsar. The food taste rather good and authentic, with a reasonable price considering it's location in Bangsar. Compared to the other Indian restaurants in the area, I would recommend Ananda Bahwan over others any time, considering it's food taste and price.it is located in the back street of jalan travers. this is a 2 shoplot and one of which is a/c. From breakfast till dinner they serve a fully range of authentic indian food.They serve pre-cooked food all laid out for to choose from and you will be billed accordingly. they have both vegiee and non-vegiee food. there is also al carte from the menu.

The food taste really delicious, the environment and the staff really make customer feel comfortable to dine in at the cosy place.suitable to celebrate any event or ocassion.

Pricing : Reasonable for casual dining. The fusion concept was a great introduction to Malay food for the family, we tried a variety of dishes including pasta/noodles, burgers and rice. Our waitress Aisha was really helpful, guiding us through the menu, helping us to choose and prompt and efficient service. The portions were great sizes. Dropped in for dinner the other day, and ordered a healthy bowl of caesar salad with additional topping of grilled chicken breast. Drink was teh tarik.The salad bowl was huge! Filled with greens and chunks of bread crumbs, it has a tangy taste perhaps due to the dressing, which i cd not recall what it was. Trying to finish the bowl was an effort but the grilled chicken helped: savoury morsels of chicken breast lined on top of the salad were a delight to the palate, and to the conscience too as this is protein grilled healthily...but the teh tarik? Guess this is a concession: healthy food and not so healthy drink. TT at M&T is different from mamak outlets: tall mug with hot, not so sweet, creamy tea and milk concoction that did not do anything to mar the otherwise overall healthy choice of food for dinner.",3,171,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Big Babas is authentic. From the decor/ambiance right to the food. We ordered the mixed vegetables, the ikan tenggiri (mackerel) chilli garam, assam prawns, chendol and chin chau. I'm a fussy veg eater but I'm glad to say this was good. Fresh veg, beans, ladies fingers, leafy veg etc fried in a spiced paste of some kind (nyonya I presume).Similarly, the ikan chilli garam had a lovely crunch to it and the chilli sambal was very good, without being too hot. If there was a complaint I'd say the sambal was limited. A little bit more would be better.The assam prawns was great with the sweetness complimenting the sourness.I enjoyed the chendol as the ice perfect.Had a good meal here. Big portion of pai tee. Cili garam fish was the best dish.. Very tasty. Eggplant also simple but good. Vietnamese white coffee was strong and not too sweet. Good service. I would come back.Cute little place. Quite dark in the inside and quite hot even though there is ac and fan. Decor is pretty cool. Service was good. Food was tasty. Ice kacang was nice as we asked for extra cendol. Surprisingly on a Sat it was empty. I like it cos I didn’t have to fight with crowds. Parking was easy too. Customers who usually make comebacks 1. Ayam Buah Keluak 2.Curry Debael 3.Asem Pedas 4.Sambal Petai 5 Pong Teh Chicken. I usually don't expect too much from Nyonya restaurants as a lot of them have rather off Nyonya cooking. But that doesn't stop me from trying. And so I was at Big Baba. I must say this restaurant surprises with its delicious authentic Nyonya cooking. We had the otak otak, Devils / Debel curry and bubur cha cha - all which was amazing. Only let down was the cendol which didn't had the same richness as the other dishes. Had lunch at BBB. Ordered the beef rendang set @ 15.90 and my partner had the assam pedas @ 17.90. Tastes good but the portion served doesn't justify the price. It's measly. Bubur cha cha served @ 5.50 is nice too. Sweetness is adjusted according to your liking with a jar of gula melaka provided. I liked the idea. Service and ambiance is good but BBB is not exactly a very affordable place for meals if portion is served like what we had today. Cash only! Really nice food. Great service. Thoroughly enjoyed the very authentic Nyonya food. Reasonably priced and good portions. Pleasant atmosphere too. Highly recommended. This restaurant was recommended to me by friends and it seems to have garnered great reviews on Facebook. We had the set lunch menu of beef rendang and fish curry, each individual portions served with rice, achar and ju hu char. The curry fish was fresh and had a generous helping of okra, eggplant and tomatoes. The beef rendang was really tasty though I would have preferred the meat to be more tender.",3.5,15,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Also tried their goat brain fry with egg. It was unique and tasty.Anjappar was known for its authentic chetinnad food, but I have to accept we were lil’ hesitant to try as it was a bad bet in Singapore. This place became a haven for us in our trip. We had breakfast, Lunch & dinner from Anjappar as our hotel was just few yards from the restaurant. Good service, clean place and great food. After being in KL for a total of 4 weeks, it's pretty damn difficult to be having local food and not crave Indian style fish specially if you know how it's made in places like Chennai or Andhra etc. I had a few meals here to rejuvenate my taste buds and surely it felt great. The fish is definitely good and so is pretty much all the other stuff we had here. Service is quick although not the friendliest but gets your work done well. Price is in line with other similar level restaurants so no complains there. Must visit.. A good upmarket Indian restaurant to dine with some dishes which are not available at other Indian restaurants. I have been to this restaurant many times and never once disappointed. My favourite dish is the fish manchurian. Good service too. Go check it out if you need south Indian Briyani cuisine made in Malaysia, this is the place to go. I love it.  Came for our anniversary. Ordered Briyani rice, and oh yea, they have one of the best briyani rice in KL. Im very picky on my briyani selection, and i love to eat briyani, and Anjappar's has one of the best briyani. Definately will come again. Really good food that's worth the price. Got 2 chicken biryani dum , and the portion was just nice. The mango lassi was really sweet but refreshing! Overall really good experience, just that the place was a little hot since the AC power was a little down. Looking for a light dinner at traditional Indian cuisine and decided to try it here. Masala tea is thicker, slight sweet taste and lesser spices taste. I would prefer strong spices taste with no sugar and less thick texture. Thosai masala has generous portions of chutney, the thosai is up to the standard. Worth a trial.",3.5,82,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Clean restaurant and friendly restaurant owner.A sparsely decor but functional dining, open seatings restaurant. Parking is sparse especially on a ""Pasar Malam"", a ubiquitous night market in Malaysia.Friendly waiting staff, serving food very soon as ordered.We started on Masala Papadam and Chicken Tandoori, nicely roasted in a Tandoori oven, not dried out like some places. Liked the Mutton Briyani, and the various Garlic, Cheese and Buttered Naan soaking up the Mutton Rhogan Josh and Chicken Tikka Masala.We have lived in TTDI for quite some time now, and Namaste had been our go to place for fancy family outings. We even ordered in for our daughters naming ceremony.However we stop our visits after the food started to fall in quality.In Dec 2017 we decided to give it another go and were plesently surprised to find the good old taste back.As i have said the place is a bit fancier than a regular banana leaf place, so the price is going to be high.Our trick is to go as a family and bring dishes to share. A plain rice is pretty generously portioned and can be shared by two large adults. The dum biriyani is nice as well. Something i have not seen elsewhere is the kerela chicken (maybe spicy) which is a must order for us everytime.If you can get hold of the menu (dishes are typical indian fare, butter chicken etc), you can call them and make reservations with order so you don't have to wait when pressed for time.The accoustics are pretty loud so tends to get loud with more people in the restaurant but i feel it is part of the experience.I had given a tough review earlier and am happy to write this as an update to my earlier review.The masala chicken is very yummy. Tastes if spices infused in the curry. Another must try is their fried pepper mushroom. A decent place for dinner. During lunch hour it's hard to find parking in ttdi.A gem of an Indian restaurant located at TTDI. Highly recommended for the variety on selection and affordable prices.We occasionally order delivery from Namaste, and are generally satisfied with the food. The garlic naan is sufficiently garlicky, and the briyanis are tasty. Not the best, but tasty enough. We also like their deep-fried bitter gourd and bendi (ladies' finger) dish.The food here is very good. we had an array of dishes here which included the Shark Fish Puttu, Egg Podimas, Kerala Fried Chicken which were all excellent, Fish Curry, Mutton Fry, Butter Chicken which were good. The Briyani rice was quite plain but went well with the dishes.Yes, there was a smell the moment we pushed the door open. Smelt like cigarettes, not the lovely Indian spices, unfortunately. And we were 1 of the only 3 tables of customers at the time. No one was smoking. It was an old smell for sure. We got used to it after a while.Ordering was a breeze but they got me the wrong drink. I asked for a sugarless masala tea but it was sweetened. They changed it for me immediately. No problems.We had Karala style fried chicken and the yellow dhal. These were our old time favorite here and as always, they didn't fail the standards. You ought to give them a try as they are premium stuff. The goat biryani rice we tried the first time here was also very delicious. The goat was a big chunk on the bone. I noticed my boy sucked the bone marrow out with a satisfying grim on his face.The server noticed small details such as we ordered 2 kinds of rice to go with the food. We were able to cancel one before it was too late. Thumbs up for that. Well, one serving of rice was aplenty!!!I have eaten here twice. The food is very very very good!.....but the chefs are very very very slow! I see the food panda delivery coming and going many times. I'm not sure if it takes a while to get the food out because many people order delivery or if many people order food delivery because they are very slow?(the chicken & the egg dilema). But i do know that if you are not in a hurry you will find it to be one of the best indian meals you have had! Yum yum!",3,35,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

The food is amazing. The prices are good and the shisha is perfect. Atmosphere is good also with many seating options. You must come here and try food shisha i highly reccomended it !! We were staying at the nearby IBIS KLCC and needed somewhere to eat at 11pm. We bumped into this place by accident. The food here was excellent and we were impressed with the prices. Well Worth a visit. It's a good place to chill with friends and family, the food is nice however the texture of the meat kababs are weird but the chicken is juicy and amazing. The shisha is smooth and nicely done. Friendly staff and worth the money. The food at this gem is amazing. We ere served by Judy she spoke good english knew all the dishes and made good recommendations. we ordered lamb kebabs, Tahsrib (lamb shank served o er naan soaked in gravy) lamb maghuat (aromatic rice with the most tasty moist lamb) white bean gravy and another dih i cant recall its name it was made up of lamb shank in red sour and spicy gravy. Everything we had was extremely tasty and reasonably priced. We will be visiting this place at least twice a month. Food was just too good. I visited last night and the night before. The night before that I went to Totti the Italian restaurant next door. In terms of value castle beats them hands down. And much healthier and filling meals to be had here also. A grilled chicken kebab (22rm) and hummus(10)entre was easily enough for me post gym and I'm a big guy. The guys working there were nice too. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone. In fact I wish it was as close to my hotel here as it was to my actual home. Be here once a week at least. whenever i miss my iraqi cuisine in kuala lumpur i go to eat in this nice rest. you could sit inside enjoying the A/C envirnment or sit outside looking to berjaya hotel jalan imbi monorail station. it is a little expensive like all Arabic restaurants in kuala lumpur.but all in all it is ok.

Service in Kuala Lumpur 3/5. The restaurant clean and no need to queue. All is about korean food. The samgyetang 4/5. We enjoyed the set meals of ginseng chicken soup and bibimbap. The meals were delicious and reasonably priced. The service was very good too. Highly recommended!Went with two other friends for dinner. We ordered the 3-4 persons meal set and it was worth it. Soon dobu jigae was nice, and the beef with fried egg (can’t remember what it’s called) was wonderful. One of us can’t take spicy food but he enjoyed the spicy jigae! Surprise suprise! Food was easy on stomach and very fulfilling.I had never heard of this place but went with a friend who had been there previously. There is quite a lot to choose from on the menu. The prices are good, especially the set menu. The service isn't super speedy but reasonable. The food is very good in a decent sized portion with variety of side dishes. The place was classy and comfortable for group or couples. I will definitely come and try again Dubuyo @ NU Sentral.Would consider this a Korean fast food place as it feels less like a restaurant. Came with a bunch of friends and they requested second helpings of the side dishes (it's good)! I don't take so much rice but I have friends who love it. The japchae is good. The pancake is great, if you like crispy pancakes, get this. The fried chicken (spicy, forgot the flavour's name) is yummy. The spicy seafood tofu stew was gooooood. I forgot how much it cost but it's between reasonable-cheap for Korean food. Would come back here if I chance upon this restaurant again.Very good value with their set meals and the food was very tasty with good portion sizes. Very much a fast food ambience but the food more than makes up for that.Food was good, halal Korean food isnt readily available in most parts of the world. Korean food has include beef bbq and lots of spices, which is desirable in most Muslim cuisines.Clean and nice food, staff attentively with tour order, only one thing is staff will not entertaining you if you just stand at the entrance waiting for them to please or serve you....welcome yourself dont be shy and choose ur table and raise your hand then only you feel its their restaurant style.....hope gonna change. I visit this restaurant every month twice. Nice food.Loved this. we stopped for a late dinner and wanted to experience something different. we ordered and the food came out super fast. there was so much to eat! 3 side dishes, a soup, your main and rice. was all very tasty and the bill didn't come to much either. staff were nice and it was a nice quiet experience.We were joining a conference in Sunway Pyramid Convention Center at that time. On the last day, the event ended late at night and we haven't had our dinner yet. Then we strolled on the food places' floor and decided to try a place, but we were rejected as they said it has closed already. Then we walked through and saw Dubuyo was still packed inside.",3,67,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

They had really nice Hainanese Chicken Chop there.So, I wanted to bring my other half to try Tappers at another branch. Sad to say, the food tasted different. Do take note that some of their food are like pre-cooked food and they just needed to reheat it up. We ordered the Nasi Lemak and the Hainanese Chicken Chop. The nasi lemak was tasty but chicken was just 1 small drumstick. the chicken chop portion was smaller than I last had it and the sauce somewhat tasted different.I have tried few menu already, Nasi Lemak is the best I can say :) The interior is beautiful that you feel warm and relaxed sitting in the cafe and by having an important discussion as well.Ordered the fish lasagne. Doesn't look like it was freshly prepared. Could see the tag fish lasagne still sticking to the aluminium container the lasagne fish was served in. Looks like airline food, that has just been heated up in the microwave oven. Disappointed!Maybe it was because we were there at about 9pm but most of the food was sold out. even desserts.. and waiting time was horribly long!!Most of the times i been there during Breakfast and lunch. The price are reasonable for an executive level. Average RM15 per-set included drink. The set breakfast and lunch have around 15 or more variate.Nice decorations with white paintings. The selection and food taste is average but the price is reasonable. The brunch selection is quite good for its price.The restaurant only open for business at 10am if follow the opening hour of the mall. However, they were flexible enough to let us start our event at 9am. We were allowed to bring our own morning snacks (finger food) and had them with their coffee and tea. They helped to rearrange the tables and chairs so that we could set up our projection screen and projector. We occupied the indoor part of restaurant with the door closed for privacy. The have plenty of seats for other patrons at the foyer.The food was good and the portion was generous. However, for a restaurant who claimed to have experience in serving company events, I think they were rather disorganized. The choice of menu was decided before the event where all participants may choose their appetizer, main and dessert from the customized menu. On the event day, all tables were pushed aside and everyone was seated in cinema setting. The restaurant handed out the customized menu template for everyone to tick their choice of meal. However, the template was not very well designed and created some confusion on how to fill it up. Moreover, everyone was seated freely hence there were no table number to refer to. I had to write down what each and everyone was having from appetizer to dessert and ensure that the food was served to the right person during lunch. It would have been easier if they email us the menu template so that the staff may take their order before the event.",2.5,30,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

We saw it walking by on a business evening and then came back after dinner. The lamb kefta melt is to die for. It's Lebanese food so it's slightly different IMO than greek. The chef was making to order wrap bread on the rotating griddle. Amazing, cheap stuff. We loved it that much, we went back two more times. The manager was a super cool guy who made sure everything was good and we talked for a while. Prime location right in the shopping area.Great location which serve Arabic food like manakeesh and Shwarma plus Hookah near to Pavilion and in middle of Bukit Bintang. The staff were friendly and helpful, I also liked the food it was clean and I enjoyed the shisha it was very fast service. I enjoyed a good quick meal here with my wife and friend. The food was very good and relatively inexpensive ... excellent value. I will go back. My rating would be 5-stars for value but they provide Hookahs for customers and that detracts from the food enjoyment. None the less, I will return. (Three of us enjoyed a meal for $110 Myr.) On the street just outside Fahrenheit shopping mall on Bukit Bintang and very convenient if you want to stop for a drink or a meal in the middle of the hustle and bustle. You can get a full meal or just a drink and a snack . The dips were excellent and we loved the Kibbeh and Falafel too. A nice cold beer and free wifi -what more could you ask for after a morning shopping in the vicinity? I would definitely go back next time I am in the area.I believe they also have a more formal restaurant inside Pavillion shopping mall, but we actually enjoyed the casual atmosphere at the streetside cafe. Service is good we wete sitting 9n the shopping mall side . Very nice menu choice with fresh vegetable. Lentil soup was very good. Al-Amar Express is located in Bukit bintang area just outside the Fahrenheit shopping mall. It is bang opposite Gran millennium Hotel and just across the road from Pavilion. I had dinner 3 times in last 1 week at this wonderful place. Whether you eat here or get the food in take away, the experience is awesome. The prices at this express outlet are approximately 1/3 or less as compared to the al-amar restaurant in pavilion. however the taste is awesome. I loved the Houmous with Shawarma. The maqboosh rice with chicken is awesome and finger licking good. I tried the burger and the Chicken Shawarma wrap also. everything is wonderfully prepared. The prices are decent and location is awesome. I will definitely eat here again on my next visit to KL.",4,20,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Check out its dendeng beef that is to die for.They open as early as 8am and during weekend as well. Mee kicap and mee curry is good.

Reception lady is well behaved. But the quality is not upto the mark. Food served lack authentic Thai taste.very nice decorations on higher floors giving a good view of the busy streets. Food is typical thai dishes, a bit too hot for me.Most shops close at 10pm so when I found out from google that this restaurant closes at 12am, my partner and I made our way here. The tom yam seafood was pretty good, the kailan with salted fish and pandan chicken were alright but the salted egg calamari was quite horrible; too dry and rubbery.My first visit here and they have special protein like Lobster, Soft Shell Crab as option rather than the conventional Fish & Protein. The Green Curry Chicken has a exquisite taste which I think it's one of the herb or ingredient. Will be back again.Authentic decor and delectable food ! The decor is quite well maintained and the staff is quite knows the food the are dealing with ! The menu is exhaustive and worth the try. Try the fish with garlic and lemon sauce !One vegetables, a fish, pandan chicken & tom yam, drinks for 4 pax came to a whopping ~RM250. The food and service isn't bad but only average at best. The tom yam is spicy but nothing special. Besides the highend decor, I for sure, wouldn't be a returning customer again.Went over for dinner with our customer, ordered pandan chicken, thai green curry, thai red beef curry, sizzling taufu and sweet sour fish. Food was good and ambience was great. Only set back , my plate was taken away as soon as i put my fork down when i still wanted to have some food.Another Waiters did the same to my colleague, need some training i guess.Heard good things about this restaurant. Decided to give it a try today. Arrived there at 5pm and whole place was dark, but they are open! Okay never mind, maybe they were saving electricity as no customers were around. Waiter took us upstairs and turned on some lights and aircon. Place still dim. Food was good. Had lamb, beef and veg. After we paid the bill, we walked downstairs and walla the ground floor was fully lighted!!! I asked the waiter why the ground looks so bright and happy, he said it was for big groups! So there is a difference between a couple and a big group? I was not pleased as upstairs was dark and mind you, the food was not cheap. Not a nice way to treat customers, eh?Food was good. The fish was fresh. The chicken basil is something you must try. Although the tomyam seafood was a little disappointing, I've had better ones here before. The prawn with glass noodles is alright.

The one that I'm always looking for whenever I'm craving western food. And of course my treasured menu, Chicken Chop and the fries. I'm rarely eat steak or lamb as I find its tough to cut the meats. At here, you can prefer to enjoy your food indoor or outdoor. Most of the time, I would prefer indoor because they have aircond inside . Best place to satisfy western cravings. Affordable price, luxurious portion. Good time with family, friendly staff too.You can get western and Malay food here. The western food are nice but do try the asam pedas set. YUMMY. Famous for its mixed grill,its a right choice for big eaters.The chicken chop also is a big hit.The price are reasonably fair and for the dessert ,try the waffle with ice cream.There are also asam pedas with rice and range of other dessert at the counter.The best asam pedas in town, western food also not bad and must try and i love mushroom soup, good service and very fast but crowded with customer and limited parking space. All the dishes that we ordered was good but not great. But 1 thing excellent, all 5 food that we ordered can be served in 5 mins even the crowd is full house. I went there with my family last week for dinner..made a reservation and ordered early. (the place is always crowded, so it's highly recommended to make a reservation especially if you decide to bring a large crowd). We ordered the asam pedas set as usual. The portion is sufficient for one person and the price is also cheap (RM12 for a whole set, drink is included). I don't think anyone should expect more from this eatery (especially for the western food) as it is like any other restaurant. I can't say anything about the western food since i've never try it before but my mum seemed to like it (It's cheap too!)The ambience is nice, the service is AMAZING. I've been to much more expensive and classy restaurant but the waitress/waitresses seemed to be lacking of training (hardly smiling, don't even know what to suggest in the menu, looked kinda lost sometimes).",3,17,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

We have eaten both in Mid-Valley and Jalan TAR outlets. They are famous for their sizzling steak and chicken. Mid-Valley branch also taste as good as the Jalan TAR orginal outlet. I have eaten there since I was in the younger days about more than 40 years ago.We went with not high expectations due to not so good word of mouth feedback. Tried the sizzling steaks. Have to say that the steaks were well cooked. My medium steak was medium, not overdone despite the sizzling. The meat was tender, although there seemed to be quite a lot of fat. However, the actual sizzling was pretty poor! By the time the dish arrived, there was hardly any noise left. There was not a lot of fries and only a very small salad that came with the RM 50+ dish, so it was not cheap, but overall a nice steak. The waiters are no longer in white tops and black trousers and are not chatty, but the food and drinks came quite quickly. Overall a good experience.We ordered the signature dish, Hainanese Chicken Chop and Mamak Mee Goreng. The chicken chop is crispy and aromatic. Love the sweet and sour sauce. The mee goreng is spicy and delicious. It will be better if the chef reduces the salt.An old classic restaurant offering sizzling steak, popular back in British colonial days now has a cafe style branch in Mid Valley basement. The sizzling Tenderloin steak is tender , its brown sauce is excellent, the chicken cordon bleu well cooked - crispy breaded with melted cheese. However both Pumpkin & Mushroom Soup are lacking in flavour and bland. The prawn cocktail is a disappointment.Hainanese chicken chop is the signature, the gravy however a bit too little and to topup sauce has to add RM3. The steak and the chops are considered good as compare to the wok-fried dishes and the price a bit pricey too. Nothing mind-blowing thou.Took my mother for a quiet lunch during a weekday. I’ve always heard how amazing the food is from this restaurant that was among the notable places to go for a good western meal back then.The manager took full responsibility of the mistake and waved the payment of this bad order, so we only had to pay for the other things we ordered and he even gave us a complimentary cake as an apology to the poor experience.Meat is tender & delicious served with boiled vegetables, salad & potato chips.

A dish which ignites fond memories and one that is greeted with much anticipation during our family reunions especially during Chinese New Year. It it shared amongst loved ones and with much laughter. A very fitting dish for a cafe with a deeply rooted heritage. Despite enduring the difficulties of a delivery service, the chicken chop arrived looking a beautiful golden brown with an extremely fragrant aroma seducing the diner’s taste buds as we peeled away the cover of the take away box. The pork chop was encrusted within crusty and crunchy breadcrumbs emitting a symphony of crackling as we sliced it bite-sized. The meat was tender and juicy within, topped with a tomato based sauce with onions and mushrooms which gave the dish a hint of sweetness. The dish was complete with a sea of crunchy green peas and garden fresh salad with a downpour of chips.The best Hainanese Chicken chop in town! The meat is so juicy and tender. You'll feel that you're going back in time as this cafe has been around for a very long time. I suggest this restaurant for western food lover.Enjoyed the ambience of this institution with its unique origins in Britain/ Hainan. Attentive service, very clean. Recommend to others for dining with family.Its never been about fine dining, its always about a local place to enjoy good food, and good company and that doesn't change. A step back in time. The steaks are good as always, as is the rest of the menu. The bar is not always busy with locals these days as they have taken the car park behind it away for re-development, but with an hour or so to kill at the bar there is a strong chance you will strike up a conversation or two. The staff as always are welcoming and friendly, this a place where everybody mixes and gets along, I wish there were more places like it on my travels.Cold tap local beer plus tender, perfectly cooked sizzling steaks and fries. This place never disappoints. Good for families and couples. The charm is in the colonial and early independence history. Coliseum was a hang out for British and Malayan officers as well as Chinese Tong leaders and insurgents making for many fascinating incidents. Some of the wait staff has been there 40 years.We were served by a very friendly & helpful (couldn’t get the name). We ordered the Sirloin Steak, Ribeye, Beef Pulled Burger, Mushroom Soup, Garlic Bread, Cream Brulae, & Banana Fritters with Ice Cream.Ribeye tasted perfect, Sirloin Steak is a bit too rare, the rest just perfect. Dessert : Fried Banana Fritters & Cream Brulae was delicious, simple but .Coliseum cafe is a pre-WWII grand dame of a steakhouse that’s a little worn down, sporting original mosaic flooring, dated dark wood furniture, elderly Hainanese staff etc ... but all the more atmospheric for it! I had rich oxtail soup with 2 large chunks of tender oxtail, “baked” crab in shell (it’s fried actually), sizzling mixed grill smothered in delicious brown sauce & banana fritters with ice-cream ... all very tasty! It’s just a fairly short sheltered walk from Bandaraya LRT.Walking in, for the first time, I felt a sense of nostalgia. And it just grew. Seeing Lat's sketches on the wall, reading the news clippings, seeing the incredibly polite and courteous staff.. the place reeks of old school opulence.My husband and I were able to have a peaceful meal, as one of the kind staff kept my 4 year old entertained enough. He would gesture to her frequently to chew her food and get a refill and I just found it all so endearing!. Part of the enjoyment of going into Coliseum for drinks or food, is the fact that it hasn't changed for years and years. Still a lot of the old furniture and some great photos on the wall. All that is part of its charm. Drinks are always good there and the food has been improved with a more modern menu - inc wagyu beef options. I still go for the mee hoon, and also love the baked crab. Had two of the latter yesterday afternoon and they were first class - together with a glass of wine white and a large does of nostalgia, it turned into another smashing visit.",3.5,331,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Coliseum Cafe @ Little India.jpg,,

He rolled his eyes and told us ""kitchen just told me"". Rude waiter. Nice place.""Choose a different order, that menu isn't available"" with a straight face. After one of us politely ask him ""eh? You only tell us this now?"" He rolled his eyes and told us ""kitchen just told me"". Rude waiter. Nice place.Even on a hot day the restaurant is cooling - there is no air con sitting, only fans but the greenery around the restaurant make it cool and relaxing. There is a simple buffet menu to try the food and prices are quite reasonable. For the main menu the dishes are morto exotic and well prepared thus the premium. Go for the local smoked dishes that comes with durian tempoyak...its special. Restaurant has a Balinese feel but food is very Malaysian. NO PORK is served.nice ambience, staffs are friendly ,service is good,food is good ,reasonable price and NO MOSQUITOES!!yay love this place!",2.5,42,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Come to this restaurant in the heart of KL. Although, the service is a bit slow and the cleanliness is average but the food is still AMAZING. The price is just nice. Overall, this restaurant is astonishing.A Banana Leaf Rice that I would recommend is Vishal in Brickfields. The place is packed to the brim and you need to share tables with strangers.A birthday treat for a special friend - we had stir fried sura puttu (shark meat), mutton varuval (dried), 2 think pieces of perfectly fried tenggiri and spicy squid perathal. The mango curry and mutton dhall were awesome. Curd was a little too sour for my liking. Finished off the meal with brew coffee. About RM60 for 2 persons.It seems that this resto is popular especially among the local indians in Brickfields area~ I came & ate here by 5 in the afternoon and there're still many people~as I see more than 90% who eat here are indians. This proves that the food are authentic. I tried Nasi Biryani with Chicken. It's a huge portion of rice with fried chicken, egg and three different types of side dishes. I also ordered teh/tea tarik. Taste really good. It costs around RM 13.The food is excellent especially the banana leaf. There is free flow of vegetables water and tasty hi Ken and fish curry sauce. You sit in rows like a class room setting. It always packed a testimony to its popularity and taste. Real authentic Indian food. Parking is a problem but you can park at the street behind. Relatively cheap.Indeed, a very authentic banana leaf meal, probably a better option to stick to vegan. I find the Mutton curry weak and simply too many small bits of meat with plenty of bones.They'll heap the rice on if you don't stop them, and there's plenty of common vegetables curry and dhall from the tiffin refills. However, at the peak lunchtime it was hard to get their attention for the pappadam and deep fried crispy salty dry chillies. Simply love them, goes very well with curry and rice.",4,131,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

As a tourist, the ambience captures the Malaysian local mamak restaurants. The seats are very comfortable compared to other mamaks. Staff there are very nice as well! Each time I'm in Kuala Lumpur, I have to at least come here once. I have been here many times and each time was a great experience.Get the garlic naan, cheese naan and roti. The naans were very fluffy and best eaten while hot. We got the tandoori chicken which was full of flavour. The deep fried lamb was tasty as well. For drinks we had the teh tarek and water. We ordered a lot of naan which came with a dahl dipping sauce and another sauce which I didn’t know the name of. In total everything came to about 23.50 USD. Eating here is definitely a must if you’re in KL.Something we are always on the look out for is a good cheese naan. There are way too many cheese naans served in restaurants across Malaysia which should be called ‘an almost cheeseless naan’. We stumbled across this restaurant in OUG, which was advertising a double cheese naan and we just had to try it. We were served possibly the cheesiest naan we have ever had in Selangor, and believe me, we have tried many, many cheese naans around Malaysia.Awesome food, friendly staff and great location, that's Stevens for you. Looking for some finger licking food in KL? head straight to this place. Do try their cheese naan and fresh fruit juices. And not expensive at all. Your tummy will thank you.Great place for late night supper with friends on a Friday night. Highlights would be the cheese naan and tandoori chicken. Service isn't as great as before. Price is above average but worth it as they kept the food, ambiance and cleanliness up to par.This is the place ive been going to since 16. MY fav is still the cheese naan and garlic. Yummmmmm. No one can make it like they do. Milo ice blended and fries ( i know fries !) is my go to when i'm here. they have delicious fried rice,nasi lemak series and array of so much more. Te atmosphere is not my type but i go there down time to sneak in my tummy cheese nan .We ate here while we were doing our self serve laundry down the street...cheaper than naan corner in Ampang and food is good!Me and my friends favourite hang out spot after midnight!

Their famous ladies fingers curry vegetables and potatoes with cauliflowers are their speciality and should try. Overall food and service are awesome and splendid. Wonderful Sunday evening. The restaurant was bit expensive but the quality of food was decent. If fact this was the best Indian food I have during my stay of 4 days in Malaysia. There Punjabi Channa and Kulacha were a treat.I had a bite of dinner here and it was perfectly pleasant. It seems to be off the beaten track in the Pavilion Mall, but good and I would go again. I had the Palak Paneer, and a garlic naan. The staff were attentive and efficient. A lot of money has been spent on the trappings, so it's not your bargain mall curry shop. I enjoy a good bargain mall curry and actively seek them out. This is not authentic cheap food. You order from the menu and get what you order. If you didn’t get something, it’s because you didn’t order it. Simples. I like that the menu is colour coded - with vegetarian dishes in green, and non-vegetarian dishes in blood red.Not a truly Indian restaurant. They try to make money out of everything, which Indians do not do. For e.g we asked for some raw onions. We were asked to order salad. In India raw onions are provided free with food.An accidental discovery, and was happy to take lunch here. Staff very courteous and helpful. Food - Authentic Indian food, which was freshly prepared and tasty. We had tried vegetarian dishes and all are upto mark. Ambiance - very nice ambiance. A must try.Visited Royal India for dinner. Very tasty tandoori chicken kebabs made in rich aromatic Indian style. Service was excellent and the bill quite in line with the level of service and standard of food.This restaurant is located on the 6th floor, centre court of Pavillion KL shopping mall, so it's not hard to find it. Authentic Indian food, very nice ambiance. Lamb masala is definitely worth checking out.Had a fantastic dinner tonight. we was 3 friends there, the guy fasal recommend mix tandoori plater non Vegi and chicken Birayni was excellent and the staff is very friendly. again will be there....Very well established and reputable North Indian Cuisine restaurant conveniently located in the heart of the city.

We expected lousy service but were greatly surprised to find that there was a revamp and the service has improved tremendously. Kudos to the management for the action taken. Keep up the good work. Franchise deco, clean and utilitarian. Had a quick late lunch after meeting. Kenny's roasted are OK, fills your tummy. It is somewhat does it's purpose, had a satisfying lunch.visited the nu sentral branch. love the mac & cheese as side.. the quarter set is quite fulfilling. staff were attentive enough.Kenny Rogers have a good menu-classic roasted chicken, a few variations, served with popular American sidelines-baked beans, mashed potatoes, wedges etc. All in all very mild, gentle comfort food. Most meals also comes with vanilla or chocolate muffin (Which is more adventurous in flavor than the chicken).Good for a change, and good for those who simply cant do with spice-in other words for the mild hearted.

Nice ambiance facing the KLCC fountain. Nice again. Food and drinks at Acme were excellent! Definitely recommend the soft shell crab burger!

The service on the other hand, was downright atrocious. You would not believe how ignorant they are, waiter mumbled his way through the entire service, and was trying to rush us out of the restaurant.

Great service by the waiters, manage to provide satisfactory suggestion to feel most of the best Indian Cuisine. My wife and I ate here with some good friends of ours recently. We have eaten at Spice of India in the past, and enjoyed the food, and it continues to get better. The Vegetable Biryani, Saag Paneer, Tiki Masala and Dahl Mahkati were all excellent. The menu selections have expanded and improved since our last visit. This made it difficult to pick which items to choose (in a good way). The restaurant is also great for conversations. It's quieter ambiance makes it ideal to carry on a conversation with friends. Many restaurants are simply too loud and you end up feeling like you need to yell in order to be heard. One suggestion - make tea available in a pot. The cups of Darjeeling tea that we had were great, but we quickly needed a refill. Another option would be to provide a pot of hot water and allow us as guests to strain our own tea.",2.5,237,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

The tendons and stomach were fresh and nice. Do add beef balls. Broth not bad but could be better.If the noodles able to live up to the price, then its fine. The fact is on the contrary. There are better ones that comes with cheaper price tag out there. The only good thing is the soup.I first came across this eatery when the first outlet opened in Jalan Imbi. That was many years back and they have either moved or closed down. I've never tried Tangkak Beef noodle until today. (not the Jalan Solok original Tangkak beef noodle nor any outlets in KL).The outlet is clean and nicely setup but you can't find any locals working here except for all foreign workers so I decided to pack instead of allowing them to cook my bowl of noodle. I ordered a small tenderloin with kuey teow @ RM 17.90. Yes, not cheap! (requested them not to cook anything) Overcooking the beef and kuey teow can ruin the dish!When I heat up the soup the aroma filled my kitchen. It was fragrant and beefy! There's about 10 pcs of thinly sliced beef and the dark colored broth was generous. The tangy chili sauce too!I must admit that the broth is flavorful but the beef slices were not tender nor juicy (no I did not overcooked them). In fact, it was rather tough, so what's the point of paying extra for tenderloin! Can't imagine what the normal beef slices noodle @ RM 12.90 will turn out to be! (I'm beginning to wonder if the foreign workers gave me terderloin at all).Frequented visited the original shop at Tangkak few years back. When this place were set up ty it out but seriously my personal opinion there something missing from the taste of the soup here. Dunno what is it but really taste differ but can't do much as this is the closest to the original.Family dinner what a surprising find. The Chilli and the beef tripe is delicious. Generous soup and beef. Children loves it as much as the adults. Speaks for itself if it passes kids n adults taste.There serve a quite a few mix of beef noodle . The beef is stewed to very tender & easily chew. The soup is clear, very moderate beef favour. The food is generally quite small potion.

Hop on this tour! Such a pleasant surprise as we had turned up on a Friday night without a booking on their first day of re-opening after lockdown.

Reasonably priced and amazing service by our waiter Mohammad who was attentive and knowledgeable! Definitely will come again! * My favorite was the oyster (huge as big as my palm!) with ulam!! My favourite thing about Beta is that all meals are inspired by local cultures and use as many locally-sourced ingredients as they can to craft their courses. The asian/malaysian inspiration means that the meal is a good balance of 'fresh' and 'savory', which is different from traditional fine dining – but I definitely love it. Each meal was introduced to us by the chef and the waitstaff and I appreciate the sincerity and care that went into each course. I would also give huge kudos to the cocktail pairings, which are similarly inspired by local flavors. They really complemented the food well and I would say worth the money as the pairings elevated each course to the next level. However - do note they are on the pretty sweet-very sweet side and I would pick something else if you dont fancy cocktails. I would say that service is top-notch, from the reservation (which I changed a couple of times) to the welcome and table service by our waiter, Mohammad. Fine dining can often come across as a little pretentious, but Beta knows how to create a welcoming and intimate atmosphere.Ambiance was great, not too dark and not too bright, and cosy, as it is a small place that can only accommodate a small number of tables.

I will always take the nasi lemak with rendang chicken (must try!), dim sum (must try!), salad, fresh fruits, roti canai, curry laksa, pastry (must try!), local kuih muih (must try!) yogurt and muesli, corn flakes, white porridge with side dishes, western breakfast set, wide selection of coffee and Dilma tea, teh tarik, teh nescafe tarik, and the colourful sweets for children! Good for all occasion. I hope I can try everything here but the food selection is so much that my stomuch is too small to try all! Not only the food is nice, the space is a piece of art, relaxing ambience and thoughtful staff that helped to serve us makes a joyous start for the day! Great rooms, great service & great breakfast. Helped by Section G on morning of the last day: Annbu, Adani Prareen & Adam. I visited many times Vasco for morning breakfast during my visit at Hilton KL. This time I visited them for family lunch. In fact, I was kind of surprised when Chef Kazi, Chef Jamsari and their team were able to pullout a great “custom Malay lunch”. Had a pleasant visit for their dinner buffet. The ambience was great, accompanied by the amazing view. The food was served in wide varieties and taste wise was 5/5. I especially liked their moroccan spiced lamb shoulder that have a very exquisite taste to it. The services by the waiters and waitresses were also great. Thanks to the friendly staffs Adam, Ahmbu, Ramlah and Annuar, I had an amazing night with my fam. Thank you very much for the perfect lovely lunch, all the food are so good, nasi lemak is so full of taste, so chrunchy, end up empty the plate, we give 5star, thanks to people who serve which is adam, sanjai, noor and waran. Good food & services. Plenty of food from Vasco Restaurant. The services from Senior Outlet Operation Manager Mr Adli is very friendly and superb. Will recommend to friend and family for having buffet here. good service by annbu and adli.. very nice ambience and taste.. food is very good.. desserts also nice.

We have tried many Indian Restaurants in KL but this one is very special, the lamb was so tender and the Naan Bread was very good, the prices are on the low side and yet the food quality is very good. Only a 150 mtrs away from our hotel, what a great restaurant, it's cheap and the food is delicious. On our last day in Kuala Lumpur we'll have breakfast, dinner and tea here, that's for sure! We we're finding this place as we were searching for the perfect place to have a traditional meal. Everything around was expensive (compared to Malaysian standards) and then we found this fantastic Indian based restaurant. Staff is helpful, friendly and speaks english. The food is very cheap and yet tastes perfectly good! Nice service, nice customers, super fast cooks and delicious food for less than 30r. What else could you wish for? To me it was totally worth the visit! I loved the salt lassi and the paneer butter masala. The double cheese naan was also delicious! Honestly the best curry I have ever eaten, UK or abroad. I had the lamb masala and my girlfriend had the nasi biryani (chicken). The meat was tender and full of flavour. The curry itself was packed with wonderful flavours. The cheese garlic naan was also superb. Gutted we only found this on our last day in KL or we would be back many times. The staff was super friendly! Go here for the food. Lots of great vegetarian options. We loved the masala dosa and the daal! Reasonably priced. We'll be back for sure! Fantastic very authentic northern Indian food cooked and served by very nice staff for very budget friendly prices. Coming almost every day & loving it more with every new day. Our favorite choice: Paneer butter masala. Highly recommended! Our Airbnb is just around the corner from this restaurant, and our host recommended this place. So we gave it a try the 1st morning for breakfast. The “breakfast” menu is just ok. Not really recommended to be honest, but everything else in the menu is very highly recommended. Over the next 3 days, we continue to return here for breakfast and tried different things (minus the breakfast menu). Chicken murtabak, cheese and garlic roti, onion egg and chili roti, garlic naan, mee goreng, nasi goreng, and our favorite: Ikan masin nasi goreng! Mango lassi is also a nice accompaniment to the main dishes. We had 2 lunches elsewhere and a dinner at a place in Jalan alor, but otherwise, we kept coming back to TG’s for the great foods, variety and prices. They have it all! Highly recommended. Very affordable, traditional indian food. Good service! Visited 3 times in 5 days! For breakfast and lunch. Would recommend the naan for sure!",4.5,1000,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Anticipation of phase 2 in KL happen now we are given freedom a bit to enjoy and rejoice again with friends. We decided to go Yun House for craving Roasted Duck. We also order signature dish of aubergine fried cereal and having our Chinese tea for chill weather. Yun house is the best for small blissful gathering . Thank you to our server Sean and also Yun House Restaurant Manager Ms Pauline for keep us warm with the service.  Yun House is my absolute favourite Chinese restaurant during this long MCO period. The food is always fantastic and no matter what I have order, I am always delighted with my meal and their on time delivery services. Although can't go to the restaurant but still can enjoys delicious food from Yun House. Thank you to Chef Jimmy and the team! Also thanks to Four Season management manage so well on the delivery services during MCO. This time, I order few exquisite dim sum and teow chew rice vermicelli. So delicious! Service: We do miss the good old days where we used to WhatsApp them as their customer service was so cheerful and even followed up with us on how the meal was. Kind of reminded us of American Express service. However that was in the past. Today, everything was through their website. Packing: Unlike other hotels, Four Seasons used their own rider with a customised delivery box latched to his back, who was really chatty and pleasant to talk to and arrived with a credit card terminal for payment. This probably minimised unnecessary food mishaps which are oh-so-common. The food arrived in ordinary labelled plastic containers placed in a Four Seasons paper bag. Taste: Famed for their Chinese Restaurant, Yun House, winning various awards in the past, we decided to give them a go for delivery. Simple as it looks, the Ramen had a nice texture to them. Though a little stingy with the seafood, it was extremely fresh and swimming in a delicious broth and garnished with crunchy vegetables. Simple yet absolutely mouth watering! Booked a private room for my mum’s 70th birthday celebration for 24 people. They were very flexible with the menu to ensure each guest was able to sample each of their signature dim sum and advised me on the appropriate amount to order for a lunch party. Attentive waiter and waitress and very considerate on ensuring the elderly and children were well taken care of.",4.5,207,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Food all traditional style, spicyness toned down for thetourists I supect. Was the first time since the MCO has started at the Bijan. Glad to see that they still have the same good Malay food. Foe me personally one of the best Malay restaurants in KL. Also their service staff is very friendly and attentive. Love their terrace and it’s currently anyhow great and safe if you can dine alfresco. Will soon come again. Amazing Malaysian food, great atmosphere and lovely staff! I especially loved the creamy durian prawns. I would definitely recommend this place for a beautiful chilled dinner In KL . Could not recommend this place more! Kindest team will make sure you feel great, the inside and the outside are both really great, and extremely comfy. Service is kind and attentive to whatever unusual needs you may have, which makes it even greater. Drinks are fantastic, food is very very good, and copious. It's a wonderful place! As often in Malaysia they're blasting unnecessarily bad tech-house music, but they were kind enough to turn it down a notch! Great local Malay food, all dishes were excellent very relaxed atmosphere and friendly staff, would definitely recommend . I went dining on this restaurant for 5 days in a 7 day stay at KL. The service and friendly staff, together with amazing food for sure convinced me to go over and over again. Thank you. they serve great local Malaysian food, the environment is very comfortable and relaxing, after meal you may fo to Changkat to enjoy a drink which is a stone throw away. My daughter and son-in-law were visiting KL and wanted authentic Malaysian cuisine.. we took them to Bijan.. Fantastic service.. which is very hard to find here.. all the food came out as ordered and was delicious The atmosphere is lovely and staff are so attentive and well trained .. simply can’t fault the place. We were a big group and were recommended to come here for a Malaysian treat, and that is precisely what we got. Great food and drinks at a sensible price for a fantastic spread of starters and fish and meat mains. Around 325/head including a generous tip and plenty of beer! Worth to find! We were here with a family of 8 persons and got great service. I took vegeterian food (wich although included prawns) and it consisted of cocos milk, curry, vegetables and prawns. They made it less spicy when I asked. Delicious! They served us more rice everytime we asked.",4,1266,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Just watching the chefs in action as they dish out freshly cooked and piping hot food is enough to sharpen appetites for more good things to come. Unlike the usual buffet restaurants, there are no bulky chafing dishes in sight. Instead, the food is presented in cast iron pans, woks, chinaware or served in individual portions. Fans of Indian cuisine will revel in the Tandoori chicken, lamb, prawn with naan and other North Indian specialties. Sushi, Sashimi, Teppanyaki and many more exotic Japanese dishes are served. Dim Sum baskets are piled high next to piping hot noodles and fragrant stir-fries at the Chinese section. Desserts are a feast to the senses with decadent sweets including a Chocolate Fountain. Lovely spread for breakfast. Lots of choices. Latest Recipe LR Team were friendly and helpful. One particular menu which I love to pen it here is the humble half boil eggs. The team made EXCELLENT half boil eggs. Many hotels, big and small alike, I seldom get the perfect half boil eggs for my breakfast. Usually they were too runny not even cooked in the inside or almost hard boiled on the outside. Out of curiosity I asked Chef Rahul, who is the person at the eggs station. Chef Rahul tool great effort to explain how they made them and how they are different from the others. Now I understand. It is not simply throw the eggs in hot water and timed them. Great effort and the right machine has to go hand in hand. The customer service was excellent from greeting the guest and ensuring I was settled in my seat and ensured I had my drinks and food. Cleaned up my plates immediately too. A wide variety of breakfast spread.. Buffet breakfast is really worth it and there is plenty of variety to choose from to satisfy your palate. Very friendly staffs especially Nathan who was very pleasant and friendly and makes you feel really comfortable and welcomed. I had a wonderful time in Le Meridien KL. The hospitality was super B.

It is a little bit odd inside, no music, only one room. However, the staff were very accomodating, and we had some of the best Malaysian food ever! The food was reasonably priced too. I highly recommend you come here when you're in KL! I have a peranakan / straits chinese friend from penang and this is the place she likes to go, nonya and malay food just like her mom cooks. They also have a stall outside selling snacks so she often stops. The quality of the food is impeccable, the service is efficient and quirky, the premises are cosy and very clean, always surprising that it is not jam packed with diners.As they teach others to cook this type of food, they are experts. My friend remarks that they do not take short cuts that you may see in other restaurants, it is authentic and well done.All the way there I can only think about their curry puffs, an excellent curry puff is something I appreciate. But everything else on the menu is just as good. I often have the Ayam Kapitan, just delicious.Wide range of drinks and beer available, though with the beer you need pot luck on what happens to be in the fridge.Service is excellent and if you are a novice at Malay and Nonya food, they will happily tell you all about it and help you get what you will like.They use a lot of fresh herbs in the dishes and it is so far from what you normally get in a restaurant as to make it very special indeed.This is a great restaurant however, we were here for a cooking class as they also run a cooking school.We walked in and asked to join a class. They team at the restaurant were so accommodating. While our cook prepared the cooking stations we had a great history lesson on Baba Nynoya people. We made four dishes in three hours and everything was done from scratch. It was a great deal of fun and the food was delicious. I cannot recommend this cookery school high enough. It was an outstanding experience with great people.The food was simply delicious and the ambience complemented the dining experience. The service was also equally good. Keep up the good work folks.We arrived a bit late, but they let us in. And they were friendly as well. Food is de li ci ous and the price is very good! And try the mint&lemon soda! It even looks romantic, we sat outside!Had the opportunity to take an amazing cooking class here. We learned to make Sambal Telur, Ayam Rendang, and Sambal Heh Bee plus a demo for Nasi Lemak. Overall an incredible experience with great instruction. The teacher and sous chef were not fluent in English but spoke enough to communicate and teach effectively. The style of the course was a full demo by the instructor followed by the cooking on your own. I think they could have been a little more hands on during the self cooking, but they may have just been preoccupied with the other students.4/5 is probably more accurate If not for the high quality of the instruction and the end taste of the recipes plus the enjoyment of the experience I’d probably dock one or two points for the following issues. First, the class started pretty late with 2 students joining in an hr into the course. In general the pacing also needed work. As a result, we finished over an hr late which seriously impacted the rest of my KL evening plans. Second, I’m not sure the value proposition was exactly met. I think we cooked too much of each individual dish per person. I would have rather learned to make one or two more small dishes.In the one year we have spent in KL visiting some of the best restaurants in town, this remains our favorite place. A special treat was the effort they made to prepare a vegetarian feast for members of our family who were visiting us. From the magical Nasi Ulam, to veggie rendang, to Cendol for dessert this was a truly memorable meal. Nothing we have experienced in this city comes close. And the location in an old renovated townhouse is perfect. I plan to be back soon for cooking lessons that they offer.",4.5,77,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Again, even this was a place we had in mind and placed it here as its in the same mall. The place was full , we had to wait for about 10 minutes until we got seated. Sad part here (in Kuala Lumpur) was that none of the places gives you water to drink, a glass of water is charged , here it was 1 RM for regular water and 1.5 RM for chilled water. We ordered for a local hot coffee, iced tea and a iced coffee. The iced coffee was the best, super refreshing with mild tones of coffee as the ice melts down.We ordered Lorbak, a dish with chicken rolled in fermented soya bean sheet and deep fried. Penang curry mee had a creamy coconut based soup with noodles , prawns and fish balls. Char kway teow was another new dish , it had noodles like made with rice cake strips which had a slight chewiness to it. A must try dish here. We also ordered a drink as it sounded different and a red rubies dessert. It was kedondong also known as ambarella fruit, it had a sweet and sour taste to it. The red rubies was something different, we expected it to be sweet as it was mentioned under the dessert section. It had shaved ice but the coconut milk was slightly salty , not sure if it was meant to be that was. It had water chestnuts and jack fruit as well. Forgot to mention about the Nasi Lemak penang with fried chicken. Nasi lemak is considered to be the national dish of Malaysia. Its rice cooked with coconut milk and comes with a side of peanuts, anchovies , curry , egg and some chilly. An exceptional dish. Overall this is one place you have to visit. Its got some good ambience and even better food. We went here one evening. When we arrived there was quite a long queue but this didn’t take long to reduce down. The food was reasonably priced and very tasty. Would definitely go back. Food is very good for the price. Authentic Peranakan food at relatively reasonable pricing. Good place for lunch or dinner. I'm usually quite sceptical about eating street food in a restaurant, but I was pleasantly surprised by the street food offered here like char kuey teow, pai tee, lobak and cendol. I enjoyed the meal and would definitely visit again! Had our dinner here tonight after touring the city & KLCC. The food was nice and the desserts wonderful. The seating arrange could be improved. Each time we are in KL we will visit Little Penang Cafe for a meal. It is alway busy, so if you do not want to stand in the queue, you need to go early. Food is good and the atmosphere is great.

The food is amazing and taste.So far I love their Nyonya Laksa, cendol, sago gula Melaka and ABC. Came here many times! As a Peranakan myself, I vouched for this restaurant as an authentic Malacca Nyonya Restaurant in Kuala Lumpur. Located in Jalan Doraisamy, formerly a Peranakan enclave back in the 1930s neighboring to historic Kampung Bahru. I came for lunch and dinner. For a quieter atmosphere, do try their dinner menu with your friends or family. Atmosphere is very suitable! if you are an inquisitive foody, get to know the owners. They are very warm and friendly! Looking for good food, value for money, authenticity? Look NO FURTHER! If you’re in Kuala Lumpur, I would 10/10 recommend stopping by Limapulo Baba Can Cook. The restaurant is highly known for its Laksa because the restaurant, unlike others, actually create the curry flavour from scratch, not powder. Do note that its high demand makes it run out quickly so make sure to go for lunch! The authentic restaurant has an incredible aura and is very affordable. But besides the food and interior, the workers are super nice. When we visited, we were happily greeted by the owner who held pleasant conversation with us throughout the night. Their customer service is stellar. Hope you all enjoy it as much as we did! If you like Baba Nyonya food, you must try this. Taste more like Melacca Baba style. Cosy old style lay out. Parking road side or near by hotel.I dropped in for lunch to have their renowned Laksa Alot thicker and denser than I expected but incredibly rich and flavoursome and delicious till the last mouthful Well worth the visit “You will float out of here on a Sambal infused coconut cloud”We were here on a Wednesday for the laksa. And damn that laksa was good! Great restaurant and definitely price was even better! The quality of Michelin start restaurant with a price that makes there food accessible for everybody. I definitely come back!The best food we had so far on our 3 weeks trip from Bangkok to Singapore. Different flavours come together in one dish. This is more than a meal, it’s an experience.

The view at restaurant is magnificent as it has the view of the KL Tower...We really enjoyed the “Happy Hour” and staffs are very friendly and accommodating. Highly recommended!My family and I come here every other Friday/Saturday/Sunday for the food and drinks. We always sit outside by the fan and love trying new items on the menu. This is the second time we have been here since they've changed the menu earlier this month.Like I've mentioned we sat outside this time. We arrived at about 6.40pm so just before sun set. From our seating we can see the Menara KL and the sun set on it. At about 7.20pm the menara kl lights came on and the view was beautiful. The restaurant lights are also cozy. We were seated next to the fan which keeps us cool. However I must mention that we get whiffs of a drain-like aroma every 10 mins or so. But id say to overcome this you could sit inside.The food menu changes every 6 months according to the waiter. This time I came, I ordered the salmon with cauliflower barley risotto. 5/5 best dish of the night. We also ordered the seafood aglio olio which was lovely. We ordered it last time.we also ordered the seafood chowder pie again with mantao buns. The soup was filling and the pastry matched well. We tried the chicken with palak paneer also. Id say this dish got a 4.5/5 just for its size/lack of quantity of the elements in comparison to the other dishes. The chef is phenomenal.The service is 5☆(star). The staff has recognised us as regulars. We have gotten 20% off vouchers for future dines and they are in general very attentive and friendly.We had dinner here. There was a happy hour for cocktails until 9 PM which made them cheap at 8 RM for a mojito! The food itself was also amazing. A bit pricy, but that is to be expected in this area. When you sit outside there is a nice relaxing ambience. The highlight of the night was the amazing service by mister Enam, who attended to all our needs, can take pictures for you as well. Him attending to our needs is what made our night perfect. If I am ever back in KL, I will be sure to come back.Food quality as ok. Extremely expensive for very little portions. The restaurant has a gloomy atmosphere, table clothes were stained, they don’t have drinks that are in the menu and the overall experience was below our expectations.I’ve been in this restaurant with a friend and we had the “perfect dinner”. High quality food, well cooked and excellent service. Definitely, the best meal in the first three days of our journey in Malaysia. I have only the picture of the cheesecake, but I ate also lamb which was superb and and looking at my friend fish was very good as well.Great place with fantastic and helpful staff. The waiter was above all our expectations and helped us a lot with taxi. The food was great! Pasta and shrimps that we ordered was very tasty.Came here for our 5th anniversary dinner, was served very well by their staff named Bobby, she gave recommendations on what was nice to have and paid extra attention to our 4 year old. We had the soft shell crab, creamy seafood risotto, seafood platter and chocolate indulgence cake. Portion was just nice.

Anyone? This is crazy good. Since im back in canada im craving that meal. This is one hugely popular banana leaf restaurant in Klang Valley. The queue is long by half 12pm.Must have is their deep fried tenggiri, and if you're game for it heap up your leaf with rice and curries.I am not sure if it is the best, but it is one of the most popular in town and the quality is consistent and the fried bitter gout is the best I ever tasted!Local knowledge is priceless, especially when it comes to tips on the best places to eat. I would not have discovered the delights of Nirwana without recommendations from two young Malaysian ladies on flight to Kuala Lumpur from Sydney. You have to try the best banana leaf food in KL they urged. There will be queues, they warned. Sri Nirwana Maju Restaurant, as it is known, is at 43 Jalan Telawi 3, in Bangsar area of KL, a short cab ride from Sentral. It’s a down to earth establishment nestled among some of the classy joints in this upmarket area. It’s open from 11am to past midnight Yes, there was a queue, but not long, as we got there about noon. But the wait is put to good use as staff hand out menus, and are happy to explain various dishes. Once decided, they take your order and you wait aside. We had a 15 minutes wait in total, not bad considering it was Sunday. By the time you are called to your table, the food soon follows. The choice is huge; lamb, beef, chicken, seafood to vegetarian specialities. We ordered one of the house speciality, fish head curry with white rice, and chicken biryani as the second choice. Each comes with a selection of vegetables, pickles, dhal (lentils), papadum and fried bitter melon slices in red batter. We had fresh lime juice to wash it all down. You can go for fresh coconut or choose from a variety of fruit juices, or lassis, yogurt-based drinks.This food is based on south Indian dishes. the flavors are extremely tasteful. Enjoying eating it on a banana leaf with your hands. You'll be satisfied you did. The restaurant also gets extremely busy as it's quite popular.Great food at reasonable prices. Always bring friends visiting here as it is a completely different dining experience to anything in Europe. Basic Banana Leaf option with a couple of extras is more than enough for 4 people and is just so nice. I eat here probably once a month and never disappointed. I am not a great veggie lover but the fried courgette that is part of the set meal is just superb. Would recommend to anyone staying in the Bangsar area.We had dinner at this highly recommended, Indian banana leaf restaurant during our 3 night stay in KL. it is located opposite Bangsar Village 2, along the upmarket Jalan Telawi stretch amongst a row of restaurants and bars. It is a simple and humble establishment with indoor and outdoor seating. Don’t be dissuaded by the queue which moves quickly. If you don’t want to queue avoid peak times! They take your order whilst queuing which means you don’t have to wait long for your food to arrive. You have a choice of fish, chicken or vegetable curries served from large stainless steel cooking pots with a ladle of rice and various chutneys and accompaniments including fried bitter gourd. The food was excellent with some amazing flavours. Also it won’t break the bank - we had banana leaf meals for two with water and mango lassis for around £8! Well worth a visit and overall a great experience which lived up to the rave reviews.",4,321,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Must order foods are sweet sour chilli crab, steam mantou to absorb the yummy gravy, wet buttered tiger prawn, salted egg squid, seafood fried rice. Will set u back couple of hundred ringgits but the foods are consistently nice!So far, it’s my favorite seafood place in KL. Basic ambiance, but amazing food at a reasonable price. Salted egg crab, steamed fish is a must try.Came with a large family group. We ordered a lot of dishes. My favorites were the deep fried fish Thai-style, which was out of this world, The butter prawns and the clams. The rice was delicious, perfectly cooked. The veggies were great, we had a few different ones. The deep fried sotong wasnt my personal favorite, but others really enjoyed it. We also got two different kinds of crabs. Service was fast and professional. Would definitely love to go back!love it restaurant is spacious, clean and do offer several great dishes chilli crab + butter prawn is my favourite reasonably good and affordable.Everytime I come to KL I have to come and visit this reataurant. The seafood is amazing. I recommend experimenting with the different varieties of seafood and discuss with the restaurant ppl to suggest best preparation. I personally love shell fish stir fried in dry chili.Unlike many seafood restaurants, I am glad this one doesn't have the waiters shouting out orders on top of the voices! Food was nicely placed in nice clean plates. Things looked hygienic. Good place to make a return!During way to city hotel from Kl airport , stopover at Hokkaido seafood restaurant. We choose sea fish from acqurium and some vegetables from display. They prepared fish curry , fish fry and vegetables soup within 1/2 an hour . Food quality was amazing!A first experience of its kind, trying out authentic chinese and thai menu. The Beef was succulently cooked, with generous portion served with rice. Enjoyed the experience.",4,123,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

I loved every single plate she prepared for us and feel so relaxed and good in her Family home! There is no better way to have a nice, delicious and relaxed Dinner with Friends or Family in KL!We had a very nice Dinner at Shamini's place. The food she prepared was delicious and we really felt a little bit like part of her Family, it was so nice chatting with her, she explained a little bit of her culture and food. We loved it and recommend it to every one ! Very special experience. Will definitely go back!I had a great time at Sham's cooking class! Sham is incredibly welcoming and the food that we cooked was delicious. We started by learning about the spices used in Northern/Southern Indian cuisine which was very interesting. We were given four recipes and as I had to leave early and couldn't eat there, Sham kindly packed up the food to go.It was a thoroughly enjoyable experience and I learnt a lot. I would definitely recommend the cooking class and if I return to Kuala Lumpur I would love to visit Sham's again!We had a very nice dinner at Shamini's place. We talked a lot about food, traditions, culture and the local life in our homes. Shamini is a kind and calm person. Her hospitality was great although we were strangers:) The food was very authentic and fresh. I've never had such a good vegetarian meal. It was a great experience to eat at her home and see how she lives and plays with her kids. Highly recommended!Sham's place is one of my fave rest. in kuala lumpur, best biryani in town, best curry i've ever taste during our holiday, This place is awesome very friendly staff, i'd guess this a family ventures..ambience is very homey, & homey meal.Definitely will come back.Thanks sham for very generous and cordial reception to us. Highly recommended !I'd just like to say a big THANK YOU for the wonderful cooking class that I attended. You gave information, sharing your passion in such a delightful way that I came away with heads buzzing.As well as showing simple, but effective, techniques to prepare a delicious dishes, Chef Sham was full of practical tips & able to explain the complex chemistry which will hopefully enable to make delicious just as well at home.Chef Sham was so patient, passionate, so knowledgeable & so good at cooking.Thank you for such a fantastic cooking class.

Ofcourse you do have small kiosks selling snacks and drinks inside the bird park. After a 2 hour walk we were super hungry and wanted some real food! The entrance to the restaurant is through the gift shop (which we missed and saw this again on our way back). The restaurant itself is designed to look like a traditional Malaysian house or Rumah Kampung. The restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is inside the Hornbill enclosure so you’ll have the hornbill come and stare at you eat . The restaurant team feeds him with tomatoes and other fresh vegetables, so you can enjoy a meal with the hornbill.  Malaysian chicken curry and rice: A very flavourful and aromatic curry loaded with chicken, and comes with a cup of rice and fresh veggies and papad / appalam.Grilled chicken burger: This is was one the best chicken burgers I have eaten. The juicy chicken patty along with the fresh lettuce and their burger mayo. The burger comes with a generous amount of fries and coleslaw. Chicken satay: We got 6 delicious skewers of satay with peanut sauce. Do also checkout their drink menu for freshly squeezed juices!We stopped here for lunch after a busy morning touring the Butterfly Park and Bird Park and before heading onto Perdana Botanical Gardens for a wander around the park (all within walking distance). The restaurant is located right next to the Bird Park and accessible from inside the park, but you don't need to visit the park to eat here.We had a delicious lunch here of mixed satay sticks (chicken and beef) with stir-fried vegetables and rice. It is great that in Kuala Lumpur you can buy the satay sticks with the peanut sauce on the side, I have a nut allergy but even I can enjoy the food here :-) although I didn't realise the vegetables are stir-fried in sesame oil so hubby had to eat them all - fellow allergy suffers be warned.We ordered 24 mixed satay sticks (which came with a little salad on the side), vegetable and rice meal, with 4 soft drinks and the total came to 111.80MYR, including the tip that is always included, so just over £25. This is expensive for a meal in Malaysia, but it is a toursity area so to be expected.

Strongly recommended. This humble restaurant didn’t disappoint. We enjoyed chicken fried rice, thai chicken, fried prawn and squid, and bitter gourd omelette. All was enjoyed by our family (two adults and two children). Great price too. Highly recommend.We had the eggs and fried kai lan, which were recommended by the owner. They were absolutely delicious. We also ordered a prawn and squid dish, which was spicy and tasty, plus lime drinks which were not too sweet. Really good value for a lovely meal.I love this restaurant. Never fail to deliver the same consistent taste. My favorites are the fried eggs. They come out crispy and serve with soya sauce ( comfort food at its best) . The fried Kai Lan and the salted egg chicken is also a must try.The restaurant is not too big. The owner are very helpful and kind. The taste is very delicious. Not expensive. And big portion. We like it. This simple place has the best food u ever will try if you are looking for locally home cook Muar food! I love it so much. Order the squid and prawns, eggs and deep friend vegetables!After tasting 3 restaurant in Alor I'll say Muar is better and since its in much more comfortable compared to Alor. We tried fried kailan, salted egg chicken, sapo seafood. Love them all and with 2 rice and crysant tea we paid RM57. We were taken to this restaurant by our friends who are locals and who frequent this place a lot. It's a great little restaurant and the food was fabulous. We had Thai style fish, Bo Aer kailan squid and prawns salted egg and kangkun my favourite. The restaurant is managed by Dixie lee who is very friendly and helpful with the choosing of the dishes. The servings are also generous so would definitely recommend this place thanks Dixie.We eat at Muar at least once every trip to KL, there are so many outstanding choices that it's difficult to know where to begin. For nonya try Muar . Dixe has been at this location for years and in a city where restaurants come and go rather quickly it's a coup to be in the same location for many years. We enjoy the fried egg dish, the kailan, dry chili chicken, the squid, I have a hard time branching out. But I'm sure it's all wonderful .its not a white table place and it's off the beaten path, but easy to find and well worth the effort. first impression come here. some of friend bring to here. this is a local food. the food is tasty, the asam kuah fish is so tasty and loved it.",4.5,104,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

If you visit Kuala Lumpur it’s a must try Chinese food place which offers great food with chilled beer. We came here for a late bite and were not disappointed. Service was great and food didn't take too long to come even though it was a busy night. We would definitely come here again and recommend it.A really unusual restaurant. Outdoors in the heart of Kuala Lumpur and jus a mile from the Twin Towers. There is an extensive menu with a large variety of meat and seafood choices.The black pepper crab is one of the best I have ever tasted.The steamboat is excellent with great choices of vegetarian and non vegetarian choices. You get plenty of time to eat and chat and there is no rush for you to leave.The restaurant can serve beer or soft drinks and are more than happy for you to bring your own wine.We came across this restaurant sheerly by chance. Having just arrived off a flight that morning and spent the day sightseeing we were tired and wanting somewhere to go for trouble free food. This was as traditional as Chinese restaurants get or that I have ever experienced. Seating area is on plastic chairs outside of the main kitchen and menus are extensive. The food was brought to us quickly and tasted excellent. They served very reasonably priced beer and all in all was a very enjoyable experience. The restaurant is located around 20 minutes from KLCC so if you don’t fancy eating in a fancy restaurant near the towers, this could be the restaurant for you.First impressions of this place aren't great. It's on the side of a large highway, there's no way you could walk there from anywhere. There's national stadium isn't nearby. You're seated on crappy plastic chairs. In fact, the national stadium used to be next door, after it moved, the restaurant kept its name as it had developed a reputation. Presumably the highway came along afterwards. And lots of restaurants seat you on cheap plastic chairs in Malaysia. In fact it makes sense not to splash out on fancy plastic chairs.The restaurant specialises in seafood and this was pretty much all that we ordered. In fact, we ordered too much. We had spiced crab which was coated in generous lashings of some delicious pink sauce. There were some small shell fish (lal-a) which were also coated in plenty of delicious savoury sauce. There was some sort of fish soup that wasn't to my taste. I think the only drawbacks were that the menu didn't advertise the portion sizes and I would have liked a little more plain rice to go with all the amazing sauce. The final bill was fairly expensive, it would have been less so if we hadn't over ordered but still pricey.",4,107,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

A little oasis with plenty of room for the kids in busy Bukit Bintang. We thought the food was excellent and the staff were so kind to our young boys who had a great deal of fun using the pool table - a lot of laughs. Thanks again!I have to say that this is probably one of my favourite bars - and that's got to do with their live band, food, - cocktails are amazing, and their ""hidden room"". Looking forward to coming back again :)nice bar for happy hour, full menu and reasonable price, i try the fried rice, not bad at all. you can enjoy happy hour till 9pm.The Rabbit Hole is an adorable spot with a cool theme. The food is asian fusion, with a mix of malay and western styles. My personal favorite was the clams. What blew me away the most though, was the good service. I would come back for the chill vibes.The food and ambience is nice. Cozy and nice music. Not too loud with great music mix. Will definately visit again.It is situated at the top of a street which is full of noisy smoke filled bars with touts outside vying for clientele. Exactly what we weren't looking for !The Rabbit Hole on the other hand is a place where you will find the locals dining and sharing a drink after work. It is very popular and the function room seems to be very busy on mos nights.From the moment we arrived we knew we had found somewhere special.

Other than western delights, it's a mini foodcourt you can get something local as well.I have been coming here for the last 20 years, mostly for the steak, and it is always amazing, never a let down! The same person has been running the steak hut and she always remembers our orders from memory and this is amazing! They also have some local dishes there which is good too! The food was so good I ordered a 2nd steak, melts in the mouth, nice cold beer and it does not break the bank. Absolutely 1st class. Wish It was in my country !Suesies is located at the corner of Jalan Ampang and the junction of the ring road just behind M Ampang. It is an institution in KL consistently serving the best value steaks on a sizzling plate.However steaks are by no means the only option as it is a food court style offering a range of options from the 7 or 8 stalls including kebabs, satay, pasta and a wide range of Indian dishes and breads. It is however hard to go past the steak from the Steak Hut and impressively once you’ve ordered once, your choice is not forgotten for future visits! Cold drinks are also available including very cold beer and a small selection of wine (bottles only).Suzy’s corner opens at 6pm although at weekends the car park can fill up quite quickly. It does however have a car wash facility that does a good car wash and also guarantees a park! Table service is provided with each supplier billing you at the end of the evening.A mixed open food court but not the enclosed type of food factory seen in most malls. A good selection of Malay, Indian, M east and very good value steaks (tenderloin under RM 50 and cooked well - medium rare that really was). Fun waiting staff who remember the orders you had on your last visit! A good acoustic guitar /singer was there on our last visit.Clientele looks a nice mix of locals and established ex pats. I believe this district was where the older ex pats originally gravitated to.We have visited Suzi's Corner a few times. The tasty food, wide selection, excellent service and outdoor seating have us always coming back. The steak is by far my favorite! The service has been impeccable every time we have gone. We will definitely be returning.Could be the best steak in KL. Comes out on a sizzling plate with chips, vegetables and choice of gravy, pepper or garlic sauce.Had few drinks with steak and chips.

What more can one ask for? Follow the locals and get what everyone else is ordering, and don't forget to order the pink drink, which tastes like Cream Soda and busts through the spicy hot goodness of the food beautifully.This place made our day as well as our stay. We stumbled upon it as we strolled around in the city and saw a long cue of people. At first we were nervous to try it because we could not understand the menu. Thank God for Google translate. We ended up having delicious Ayam Kari (Chicken Curry). Not only was the food amazing but also the people. They were very friendly and caring. We will definitely be going there often in the next 2 weeks.Amazing Roti and fried chicken the Nasi Kandar looked good to but we went twice for breakfast. The staff are all loverly and helpful and the ice lemon tea was delicious. It’s close to the Chow Kit station and close to the Hilton Garden inn and multiple other hotels. I've been to many 'authentic' nasi kandar restaurants in KL, but nothing comes close to Kudu. From balance of flavours, to just the right type of dishes (some restaurants tend to go overboard, whilst Kudu focuses on ones that they do well), Kudu gets it right. What's most astonishing about this place is the fact that prices are surprisingly affordable. The only downside is that there's almost always a queue, so be prepared to wait. However, on a good day, when orders aren't overflowing (ie people lining up to pack for their friends etc), you'll be served in under 15 minutes. Go try it if you're ever in the area - you won't be disappointed.this restaurant is located next to a main road so do expect some parking difficulty is you self drive. however, there is a lot of buses plying the area and also medan tuanku monorail stop is nearby which make it so easily accessible. having said that, do expect a long queue.I went to this restaurant couple of weeks ago. The foods were generally good. There are varieties of dishes to choose from. Parking was not a problem as there were parking spaces at the back of the shop. The only problem is the que that it can get very very long sometimes.We had late lunch here. If you loves nasi kandar, you should come and try here. It is the best authentic Penang Nasi Kandar that you can find in KL city centre. The restaurant has been here sin 1960s. Even the late P Ramlee came here for his nasi kandar. This restaurant is famous for their Nasi Kandar, with Ayam Sambal Bawang, Ayam Goreng, Sambal Sotong, Kari Kepala Ikan. Kari Ketam, Kari Udang, Telur Ikan Goreng.

Very delicious and not costly as you may perceived. The staffs and chef are chinese local elderly. I have a feel of old Chinese restaurant when I went in, those old Chinese restaurant feel 20-30 years ago. It is definitely highly recommended compared to those recent Chinese restaurant chain like Orien*** group which cost you a bomb, much smaller portion and taste not as good or maybe juz on par... I had went to the other overseas branch in Subang parade n Jaya one which is bit modern type but is great to see this first overseas restaurant in Imbi still preserve the values of authentic Chinese restaurant.Went for lunch, restaurant is large and was crowded which says a lot for it. Food was excellent and plentiful. Not a lot more to say.Overseas Restaurant at Jalan Imbi is THE place to go in KL for a good Chinese meal. Our favourites would be the sea prawns in black sauce, steamed ""Soon Hock"" or Marble Goby, the famous Char Siew(order ahead or you wont have any), specialty tau foo or beancurd, and double boiled chicken soup (may have to pre order).Great food great taste, especially their kampong white chicken. Super ""Q"" with the ginger-spring onions. Yummy! Their dim sum may not be as good as their ala-cart dishes.This is a VERY busy restaurant - we tried to book from the InterContinental hotel but were told we were on the waiting list for a table. But when we arrived we were shown to what I think was the last table! We had heard about their BBQ Pork belly to be told it was sold out. Seeing our disappointment the manager returned a few minutes later with the dish which was magnificent. We also tried the Beancurd, there BBQ goose, a prawn dish and of course rice. Washed the food down with a bottle Finca Negra SB. A truly memorable dining experience but make sure you book!We had dinner at Overseas Restorant, Jalan Imbi on Sunday, 22 Dec 2019. The restaurant was packed with diners and fortunately we had a prior booking. The menu was extensive but some items were out if stock when we were there at 7.30 pm. The honey char siew was so tender and delicious. Highly recommended for the food and the staff were also attentive. Prices were reasonable and booking is recommended especially weekends.A restaurant that has decades of history. Perfect place for private business meeting as private rooms are provided and perfect place for family that want to have a nice Chinese dinner. Frequent the place and build a good relationships with the captain who get better service in the future.The Overseas Restaurant flagship in Jalan Imbi is probably the best Southern Chinese restaurant in Kuala Lumpur and among the best in Malaysia( the World?). It is a busy restaurant serving many hundreds of patron every day and its kitchen has numerous chefs.There are staples and there are specials. The staples are belly pork with salted fish, the big head freshwater prawns(大頭蝦,) either cooked with pork lard OR with dark soya sauce are both equally delicious. The spring rolls is the old style and rarely found but must be ordered in advance. Their clay pot fried rice is outstanding and can be had with or without yam. There also do a five grain dish in lieu of rice which is very very good. Many customers also order their char siew (BBQd pork) but this sells out pretty fast. Their specials can be amazing these include a variety of wild freshwater fish (wild patin 鲶鱼,kelah 凯拉鱼or even tengkalang腾卡郎鱼) or sea fish including a delicious thread fin tuna(kurau or ma yow马友鱼) steamed in a light soya with saltfish. Their claypot beef brisket needs to ordered in advance and is very flavourful. The only problem with Overseas is service can be patchy so if you are entertaining friends a word in advance with one of the restaurant managers will help. Had dinner with a group of business associates. Food was good. Do make a reservation, especially if you want to try their Char Siew.. Will come back again when I’m in KL..",4,366,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

We went there and ordered for a medium sized clay pot rice. It starts with rice and water, then they add lots of sauces like soya, sesame oil and a few others along with chicken. This is then cooked over coal, to be frank it didn’t really wow me. I didn’t find it that good, it had way too much of soy sauce making it salty but others liked it.Earlier tonight we shared a table with another guys. We had a claypot chicken rice with ‘lap chong’ or Chinese sausages, and mixed seafood grill. Just delicious. We love it. We complimented the dinner with 2 young coconut. Perfect dinner for MYR52 or SGD17 for the two of us.Charcoal cooked claypot chicken rice. Succulent chicken meat with salted fish and lup cheong. Don’t expect too much darken rice sticking to the bottom. Delicious. Will be back again.We wanted to try the clay pot chicken in Chinatown in Kuala Lumpur and came across this restaurant. The food was good but not great. The price was reasonable 18 rm for a medium bowl which two of us shared , about $4.50 US.Pretty good freshly cooked claypot chicken with cheap beers. Rice is nicely seasoned and slightly crispy. Unfortunately no vegetarian claypot options.We had some other food in Petaling and came across this stall while just strolling around. Ordered a small tilapia and loved it! I wasn't even hungry but ate half of my husband's food . The marinade is not as spicy as it looks but together with the humidity, it can make you sweat!Been frequenting them everytime I am in KL and their food never fail to satisfy our food cravings! Owner remembers us and when he has some time in between, he would come over to our table and chat with us as we enjoy the food. It has to be the best claypot chicken rice in my memory! Cooking over charcoal fire, it has a unique taste when served. The sambal stingray is usually fresh and ordering some veggies makes the meal complete. Strongly recommended!Earlier tonight we shared a table with another couple who were kind enough to let us sat together at their table. We had 2 claypot chicken rice with ‘lap chong’ or Chinese sausages. Just delicious. We love it. We complimented the dinner with young coconut. Perfect dinner for MYR34 or SGD11 for the two of us.",4,61,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

The are SOP implemented too..My 86-year-old mother and I had the chance to dine in Gobo Chit-Chat during our stay in Traders Hotel Kuala Lumpur. We ate here both for lunch and for the seafood dinner. The food was predominantly local/Malaysian but there were also continental options. The quality of the food, the way they were cooked, and their taste were all excellent. The seafood dinner buffet was the best, as there were unlimited crabs, shellfish, shrimp and fish. What we liked the most, so far, was the fish crackers: simple and yet flavorful, and had that distinct Malaysian taste. The restaurant staff and food servers were very attentive to our needs. They were courteous and they served with smile. The prices were very reasonable considering the high good quality of food and service. We will definitely eat here again when we revisit Kuala Lumpur.Visited for a lunch, lots of variety of dishes. Very friendly staff and relaxing environment. Liked the sweets a lot.Warm welcome by the F & B Director, En Nabil who had noted my request for not able to arrive on time. And a shout out to the rest of the Team for a commendable service rendered. Excellent fresh mud crab and best roast beef I had thus far. Dinner & hotel stay was booked by my lovely daughter & son who is studying abroad for a ""Surprise Anniversary gift to mom & dad"".Will take my daughter (when she's back for Christmas holidays) and other family members here to share the good experience soon.Once in Kuala Lumpur, its a must to visit the Gobo Chit Chat restaurant at the Traders hotel.

A must try for any diner. the home of the damn shiok prawn mee...a premium hawker place at a premium shopping mall. the service could be slow at times and price is slightly on the pricier side.Was here for desserts after lunch. We had the cendol and rojak buah. Very expensive street food but well it’s the environment and service that they charge. Nevertheless, both items were worth ordering.Delicious hawker fare done in an upscale manner. I absolutely loved the Stinging Bacon with wasabi. A must try!Enchanced Hawker Fare but well worth the extra cost, had Penang Char Kway Teow with crab meat which was great and the siew yoke and Char siew were melt in the mouth. Only disappointing dish was the pork ribs which we waited for 40 min and was not meaty and lacking in flavour. Visited Champs ' Damn Shiok ' Bistro yet again. Damn Shiok is Malaysian speak for delicious or fantastic.We went there for its famous offering of Prawn Mee or what Penangites call Hokkien Mee. They do this dish extremely well and I believe it must be the most expensive Prawn Mee in all of Malaysia. Such a dish in a Petaling Jaya coffee shop costs only about RM 6.00, in Penang only about RM 4.50 but at this up market bistro it costs a whopping RM 33.00!It had a wonderful tasty soup and we chose to have it with Mee Hoon and Mee. It had 2 large prawns, three juicy rib bones with flesh and a smattering of shrimps and came piping hot. Over the years, although the price has gone up a number of times, the amount of shrimps has decreased but it is nevertheless still a winner. My wife who normally does not comment, proclaimed quite unexpectedly: Simply the Best!Prior to that, for our starters, we had our usual serving of their unique and delicious Green Young Mango Kerabu. A sort of Malaysian salad if you like but with a dash of dried shrimps and crushed peanuts. I think the dish also has some sugar in it. We make it a point to always order this dish.",3.5,48,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

They have huge selection of buffet food, Western, Asian, Indian and Malaysian, also 2 chefs there for eggs and soup noodles. Mostly what i like is here...very exciting and tasty licious food that we can eat here... Love it so much... Because of this my diet is gone... Hahahaha... Tq u to all the chef for the wonderful food.. Give it to u olls 10 star..One of my favourite restaurants in Kuala Lumpur. The food is always fresh and they tags great pains to ensure good service every single time, irrespective of whether you're on your own, with family and loved ones or clients . My all time favourite dish, the Snow White Dancing Prawns, is a must have!!The menu is a flexible mix of asian or western dishes. It is suitably varied with everything from Wagyu beef to pizza without comprising quality thanks to the multiple open kitchens specialising in their dishes.Food in Shook! is awesome. Been there a few times. The buffet spread choices is really nice with local and international choices.go for the fresh steam sea bass chinese style, my favorite Great value for money winter melon soup, yummy Lamb chop, to die for.

The food and service were well above, what you would expect. The prices are good. We even had takeaway one night and the standard was just as good.Our third time visit here. Whenever we are in KL, this will be in our food to eat list. the last we were there was in Oct and the owner said that they are moving to another location. I lost address the given I. I googled and found that they are now located at Lot 1439 A, Jalan Haji Yahya Sheikh Ahmad, Kg Bharu, 50300 Kuala Lumpur, Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Hopefully I am right. I will be in KL in late dec and will update the address.Their satays are huge and succullent. The gravy is thick with peanut n great to go with the satay. Besides satays, they also have other menu like lambchop.These satay die die must try. During my visit I ordered beef, chicken and lamb satay and I was real impressed. The chunks of meat are of a good size, but the peanut sauce is the star of the whole concoction. Tick, spicy, but not too hot,their peanut sauce is soo delicious. Dunking piece of meat in the sauce is really a pleasure. I will be back......then see if you agree with my review. Big suculent chunks of meat or chicken, thick peanut sauce and little rice, cucumber and onions. The simplicity is there but the taste is awsome. Without doubt, best satay I have eaten in Malaysia (and I have tried a few).Mouth watering satay, friendly staff in a genuine setting. Don't rely on the location on Tripadvisor, we eventually found it at the intersection of Jalan Tun Razak and Jalan Raja Abdul Aziz.Being a fans of satay, I get to know this restaurant from my friend who worked at Celcom, just across the street from this restaurant. I've known Malay-style satay before, but upon tasting their satay, I know this place is really offered an outstanding fare. The meat is just so tasty. You could even tasted its spices in the meat. It's just juicy and excellent.Its excellent taste really makes you forget that the servants are rather lousy and ignorant.",4.5,9,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,
494,Kim Lian Kee Restaurant,07:00 AM - 4:00 PM,"No. 49 Jalan Petaling, Kuala Lumpur 50000 Malaysia",+60 19-335 9203,http://www.facebook.com/KimLianKee,None,"Still one of the better places to go for a good fried hokkien mee and claypot lou shi fun. The wok heat is reflected so clearly in the noodles. And the experience of road side dining never fails to add to the joy of eating. Kitchen is clean, which is a big plus.Alright so this is pretty confusing: we did not know that there were 2 stalls located just across each other with the exact same name and menu. At first, we went to the one on the ground floor which looks like a makeshift hawker stall. Apparently from the other reviews this is the original stall, but the kl noodles there was bland, salty, and tasteless. Extremely disappointing. We left with 3/4 of the plate remaining.While eating, we realized that there was a branch opposite the road, and we went there after. This one was located on the second floor, and was air conditioned. The difference was night and day. The noodles here were fragrant with the aroma of pork lard. We polished the whole plate within minutes.This restaurant is located in the middle of the Chinatown in Kuala Lumpur. It was established in 1927. It started at a small stall on the other side of the street before expanding to this three-storey building where customers get to eat and drink in the comfort of an air-conditioned environment now. The small stall is still operating at the original site in the evening. The Hokkian Mee (Tai Lok Mee), thick yellow noodles fried with dark soy sauce is very good. It comes with pork slices, prawns, squids, cabbage and the crispy deep fried pork lard. The version here is drier and it has the nice charred aroma (wok hei). The Cantonese style fried flat noodles and bee hoon (Char Hor Fun) is equally good. The bee hoon (rice vermicelli) is deep-fried till it is crispy and the gravy is light, clear and tasty. The Loh Mee, thick yellow noodles cooked in a starchy gravy is also worth trying. The gravy does not coagulate when the dish cools. The beef fried koay teow which we also ordered is just average. Many other types of chu-char (stir-fry) dishes and soups are also available. Prices are slightly on the high side. Almost all the staff there are foreigners. Customers have to take their bill down to the ground floor and pay at a counter beside the staircase. Service is prompt but service is not as friendly as one would expect. It is open from 11.00 a.m. to 11.00 p.m.This branch is at the Gardens Mall Mid Valley LG-201B. I went along with some of my friends for Lunch. They have a great spread of food and an exhaustive menu. The Hokkien Mee was fantastic and have not had such a good preparation for a long time. Will most certainly go again. The staff was so welcoming and went that extra mile to make us comfortable.",3.5,260,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

Other dishes can be found anywhere but a vegetarian dimsum is non existent. It’s nice and delicious as well. Others offerings are nice as well especially the Curry, Assam Fish, Black Bean bitter gourd. Crowded with people on weekends.Mom and brother both adore this place so I've been here quite a few times. Food is always good, and I like that the restaurant is an easy place to hold a conversation in due to how nice and quiet it is even when there's a crowd. My folks and I especially love the salted vege soup, bittergourd soup, asam fish, crispy goose, ginger steamed fish, homemade fried noodles, crispy fried mushroom... jesus, I really might as well just list the whole menu at this point. Verdict: almost everything is delicious. And for those who're following a Sattvic diet, fear not. Nature's doesn't use onion or garlic in their dishes.I love Nature's Vegetarian in Bangsar. It is my go to place whenever I want to lay off meat for a bit. The restaurant is clean, menu is extensive, the food is freshly prepared and consistently tasty, and the service is polite and quick. Given the quality of food, I'd say the prices are reasonable, around RM80-100 for 3 large dishes with brown rice, more than enough to feed 2 hungry people.The restaurant is located in Bangsar and offers very good vegetarian food and value for money. The restaurant has an authentic Chinese ambience, decorated in traditional rosewood furniture. The menu is extensive and offers everything from light meals (dim sums) to full-course lunch/dinner, all vegetarian of course. Food is very tasty (mock shrimp tastes like the real thing) and is reasonably priced. Service is generally good, however, one may experience delays during peak hours - so it is better to come early (or later) and avoid the crowd. In conclusion, if you like Chinese cuisine, this restaurant is worth a visit even if you are not vegetarian.The dim sum here is so good! I would recommend the taro fritters, bbq buns and satay. We ordered around 12 dishes and 2 were not to our liking, but that was because of our taste, not because of the quality. We came back for another round the week after and loved it as much as the first time.If one is looking for a place to enjoy fresh, ""true"" vegetarian cuisine cooked the Chinese Malaysian way, look no further than the above, unassuming restaurant that serves great food at moderate prices, eat-to-fill quantities in a ""traditional"" Chinese temple environment. I felt we were eating amongst the gods, who had presented food that they had blessed.We are a party of 10, with diverse tastes, and yet, with careful selection from the menu, we were able to select pure vegetarian fare, without having to resort to any of the many mock meant selections.",4,34,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

497,Boss Nasi Lemak,07:30 AM - 10:30 AM,"Jalan Kerja Ayer, Kuala Lumpur 50480 Malaysia",None,None,None,"Located in a row of stalls called Nan Corner on Jalan Kerja Ayer Lama (approximately 15 minutes by car from KL City Centre), this stall is the second last stall from the end of the row. Expect a really basic experience with under cover seating and a limited range of dishes. As the name suggests, Nasi Lemak tends to be the staple here although I've noticed the addition of Ikan asam pedas (fish in a sour tomato based sauce) and ikan lemak cili padi (fish in a spicy coconut based curry) to the menu. The main accompaniment to the Nasi Lemak that tends to be popular here is the sambal squid and also the chicken dishes (rendang and fried). It's nothing fancy but I enjoy the odd visits here on a Sunday afternoon as a treat.This ""nasi lemak cikgu"" used to be located at SS5 nearby some years ago. The ""cikgu"" (teacher), whom the dish is named after, has since passed away, and the business have relocated here about 3 years ago, under a new management.The place has a cozy and casual atmosphere, and there is music constantly being played in the background. Apart from the nasi lemak, they also have a number of pre-cooked dishes for customers to add on.Since I came here specifically for the nasi lemak, I ordered the ""nasi lemak with fried chicken"". I like it that the rice was piping hot, and the fried chicken was still hot (not cold). Also, the fried anchovies and peanuts were fresh and crunchy. The sambal came in a separate small bowl - however, I find it a little watery and not spicy enough.My meal of nasi lemak with fried chicken and teh tarik came to RM9.20. The nasi lemak alone was RM7.50 - a bit pricey, but the chicken portion is decent.This place opens from 7am to 3am daily. I happened to talk to the manager (Abdul Aziz aka Chief Keegan), who informed that they also operate Azza Food Paradise, the shop directly opposite. As such, food that are being ordered are either prepared here or at Azza.I'm a regular here. For MYR4, you can get a plate of nasi lemak with either 1pc chicken, beef, or squid. That is cheap. The setting is sort of like an expanded hawker style so the rating is purely based on food quality, taste and price. It's really delicious and a good intro to local Malay food, be warned it's spicy.",4,13,Restaurant,Heavy Meals,static/restaurant_pics/Tbg.jpg,,

The freshness of the sauce was accented by most delicate, fragrant curry leaves. Even the fried mackerel was the best I've ever had, ever, with perfectly crispy skin and moist meat inside.The drinks we had including Malaysian favorite iced lemon tea, and fresh fruit juices were spot-on as well.

The bacons aren't too salty at all as opposed to a lot of the mass produced bacon in the market, locally made or imported.The sausages are made using good cuts of meats and have good ratio of meat & fats to them..arent too salty not too fatty, absolutely flavourful!One of the EXTREMELY short list of restaurants in Malaysia that doesn't use Ajinomoto (MSG) to create great taste.
