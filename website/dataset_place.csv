My personal favorite is the third level as it is closer to level 2 (in case level 3 gets crowded) and near to public toilet. Wild monkeys are around but as long as you hide your food & drinks you should be fine. Do not feed them as advised. Loved the waterfalls! Deff worth going.

It has since moved to a new location at Lenggeng, about 10mins drive from Sek Dato temple where we made our first visit with the kids on a Saturday morning. Initially I have planned to bring the kids to the other animal farm nearby which doesn't advocate the thought of tasting skewed rabbit meat, but Aves was unfortunately closed that day. Nevertheless, it was still an enjoyable experience here at Rabbit Fun Land as the area is big enough for our kids to take time and say hello to each of the animals. The variety of animals here cannot be compared to the one in Seri Kembangan but in general, enough for the kids to learn such as rabbits, ducklings (roam freely within open enclosure), peacock, goats, roosters, ponies, deers and of course the star of the attraction being the camel (though I wonder what business it has doing here in Broga, alone?). Entrance is per head basis irregardless of the child's age at RM8 (no discounts for senior citizens either pfft) and animal feed at RM10 per pack. There was a notice at the reception saying outside carrots are not allowed. I have not seen any advertisements about selling rabbit meat though. It's a self-guided place unless you want to pay more for 'guided' tour, though that's not necessary. The condition and environment of the premise is typically rustic, but the toilets are surprisingly well maintained. We didn't check out the restaurant area as it was crowded with huge group of ecstatic kindergarten kids having a field trip there at the same time, the kitchen was busy preparing and serving meals. Around the premise, a mini 'skytrex' play area and high swings seems to be a recent addition. There is also an educational part of the visit on learning the life stages of rabbits (probably for paid tour groups as nothing goes on when we pass that area), kids can also experience cow-milking but with a price (RM10!) that is not included in the ticket. Admittedly, it's not a happy place for everyone. While the cows stayed within their limiting enclosure, a restless calf was tied onto a post. :( The rabbits look stuffed when we arrived, as we saw carrots littered everywhere around them, so really, you can skip feeding them and go for the hungry deers instead as they are located further from the main attraction area. If you're not keen on buying animal feed though, you can always pick up the unfed carrot sticks on the ground instead. Overall, RM8 is reasonable for our return visit. Personally I feel that the management could do something to improve the well being of the animals now that the facilities of the place are quite complete and maybe have mercy for senior folks and kids below 2 years old with discounted pricing on tickets? To be honest I wasn't quite pleased with the way that the owner justify to us about how much we are paying versus the price that the bigger group paid for when we ask if my less-than-2-year old son can be excused from paying. Does that mean a newborn will have to pay to enter too? Anyway, I'll digress. If you feel that getting here all the way would be too much, here's a tip, you can arrange your visit during the Durian season like we did, which include a stop to sample delicious Durians here and other seasonal fruits here in Broga... and at a much much lesser price than you would have to pay anywhere else.",Yes,"P.T 133 & 134, Batu 26, Jalan Balau, Mukim Beranang (About 10mins drive from Sek Dato temple), Kuala Lumpur 71750 Malaysia",2.5,10,static/place_pics/Rabbit Fun Land.jpg
